# Session 12: Waterdeep Arrival and Dark Revelations

**Date:** [[2025-10-09]]
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party arrives in Waterdeep with Raenar Neverember, overwhelmed by the massive city ten times larger than Neverwinter. After meeting local merchants at Statue Protectors Square, Modred confronts his broken father Godwin at House De Moray, learning his family has fallen apart since he left. At the Sated Satyr Inn, the party officially names themselves "The The Icebreakers" while discussing the upcoming masquerade. That night, Modred discovers his corruption from the portal has spread dramatically, and he races to the temples with Clover seeking help as Milo and Jaspar sleep.

4. **House De Moray Confrontation** - Modred returns home to find his father Godwin broken and mad. Godwin casts Wall of Fire on the party (20 damage). Milo uses Chronal Shift to reroll and successfully Dispel Magic. Godwin breaks down sobbing.

- Susur trees exist that can cancel magic (mentioned by Gigz)
- The upcoming masquerade is hosted by House Castellers, rival to House De Moray
