# Masquerade Preparations

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> Following their arena victory, the The Icebreakers received tickets to the Castellers Masquerade. They spent the day gathering intelligence about House Castellers' suspicious rise to power, shopping for magical items and formal attire, and developing a strategic plan for infiltrating the party. Jaspar began an apprenticeship with Erik the Dwarf to learn conduit magic, while the party learned critical information about the Castellers' missing children and their unexplained wealth.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Erik_Waterdeep|Erik]]** - Dwarf Male - Gem crafter and conduit magic expert. "If you present the magic with the opposite of what it already is, then perhaps the gem will change its very nature."
- **Cece** - Cat-Person Female - Skilled tailor who made custom masquerade outfits for the party overnight.

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Gigz]]** - Created improved ball bearing device; provided intel on House Castellers' rapid rise to power and their missing children
- **[[Raenar Neverember]]** - Directed party to Cece's shop; showed trust by letting Clover walk Pogo
