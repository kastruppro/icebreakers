# Masquerade Preparations

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> Following their arena victory, the [[The_Icebreakers]] received tickets to the Castellers Masquerade. They spent the day gathering intelligence about [[House_Castellers]]' suspicious rise to power, shopping for magical items and formal attire, and developing a strategic plan for infiltrating the party. [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] began an apprenticeship with [[Erik_Phandalin|Erik]] the Dwarf to learn conduit magic, while the party learned critical information about the Castellers' missing children and their unexplained wealth.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Erik_Waterdeep|Erik]]** - Dwarf Male - Gem crafter and conduit magic expert. "If you present the magic with the opposite of what it already is, then perhaps the gem will change its very nature."
- **Cece** - Cat-Person Female - Skilled tailor who made custom masquerade outfits for the party overnight.

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Gigz]]** - Created improved ball bearing device; provided intel on [[House_Castellers]]' rapid rise to power and their missing children
- **[[Raenar Neverember]]** - Directed party to Cece's shop; showed trust by letting [[Clover]] walk [[Pogo]]
- **[[Pogo]]** - Rolled natural 20 on handstand trick; went for walk with [[Clover]]
- **[[Savan]]** - Confirmed spellbook can function as arcane focus; sold magic items to [[Clover]]
- **[[Victor Castellers]]** - Observed in announcer's box; notably did NOT clap for party's victory and left immediately

- [[Victor_Castellers]] observed from announcer's box, refused to clap, left immediately
- Party received masquerade tickets from soldiers

### [[Gigz|Gigz Gears]]
**Device Feedback & Intelligence Gathering:**
- Ball bearing device worked excellently during arena fight

### [[Erik_Waterdeep|Erik's Gem Shop]]

### [[Sated Satyr Inn]]
**Strategic Planning:**
