# The Gauntlets of Tyr

**Date:** [[2025-11-12]]
**Party Present:** [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]] (Milo absent)

## Quick Summary
> Continuing their exploration of the Temple of Tharizdun, the party solved a three-lever sequential puzzle, answered three riddles from a tragic horned statue, and successfully retrieved Tyr's Gauntlets from a chamber guarded by the Substance. Tyr appeared as a black hound, granting the entire party his Boon and revealing their next quest: find four Tharizdun ruins around Waterdeep and use the gauntlets to push the Chained One further into imprisonment. Upon exiting the temple, the party found Cora waiting for them, clapping with excitement.

## Important Quotes

> "When I was alive, I liked shiny things. Can you show me shiny things? Oh how I miss it so." - Horned Statue, first riddle

> "When I was about to die, all I could see was red, all I could taste was red, all I could feel was red. I want to feel the red again, oh how I miss it so." - Horned Statue, second riddle

> "When I was dead, I missed the light, I missed the warmth and I missed the sensation. I want to feel again." - Horned Statue, third riddle

## Revelations & Lore

- **Four Ruins Quest**: Around Waterdeep are four Tharizdun ruins, each containing a chain connected to Tharizdun's imprisonment
- **Gauntlet Purpose**: Using the gauntlets on these chains will push Tharizdun further back into imprisonment
- **Tyr's Limitation**: Even Tyr does not know where the four ruins are located; party must investigate in Waterdeep
- **The Boon of Tyr**: Allows HP sacrifice to heal another, but user absorbs all injuries, conditions, diseases, dismemberment, and even death; instant death if brought to 0 HP
- **The Horned Statue**: Represented someone who died violently (blood reference) and mourned simple pleasures of life
- **Cora's Interest**: She was tracking the party's progress and specifically wanted them to retrieve the gauntlets

- Modred: Solved the fire riddle with torch; participated in all puzzles
