# Through the Void to Waterdeep

**Date:** 2024-09-25
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party prepares to depart Neverwinter for Waterdeep via triangular portal. Liora delivers a prophecy to Clover about choosing between family and power. Milo learns the dark truth about his sister's visions from their mother. The party travels through the Void where each member faces individual trials - Clover refuses a divine entity's offer of power, Jaspar meets his celestial "father" who gives him a sample of power, and Milo/Modred/Clover encounter the ghost Sabrina Nightgale on a boat sailing through the underworld. They emerge in a forest near Waterdeep where they rescue Raenar Neverember from his own hunting trap.

## Revelations & Lore

- **Liora's Visions Origin:** Dark hands with chains emerged from grandfather's ritual portal and tried to grab young Liora; her visions started after this incident
- **The Cyst:** A floating object in the Void that may be Tharizdun's "shell" or where he originated from - unbreakable by any means
- **Shadow Mechanics:** The Shadow is summoned via ritual; its purpose is to possess people and serve Tharizdun
- **Freeing the Possessed:** The only way to free someone possessed by the Shadow is to bring them to the Void and perform a binding ritual (extremely risky)
- **Void Danger:** If the Shadow is freed in the Void, it would break Tharizdun's chains and release everything from the underworld
- **Sabrina's Party:** Consisted of Edward Hammel (human), Elise Mayak (firbolg), and Ron Tusk (young dwarf) - all likely dead except possibly Ron
- **Souls Trapped:** Tharizdun has paused the flow of souls to the afterlife; millions are stuck in the underworld
