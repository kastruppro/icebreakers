# Pirates and Dragons

**Date:** unknown
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Auren]]

## Quick Summary
> The party looted a frozen pirate ship in Neverwinter harbor, finding gold, a treasure map, and moonstones. After selling their finds and purchasing a horse and carriage, they headed to Axeholm but witnessed the white dragon fleeing a massive ring of frost expanding from the mountains. Their carriage was destroyed by ice spikes, forcing them to proceed on foot. At Axeholm's entrance, they encountered the dragon eating a goat and had to sneak past it to reach safety inside.

- [ ] What happened to the dwarves of Axeholm?
- [ ] What's the connection between the freeze waves and the larger plot?
- [ ] Will the frozen pirates ever thaw?
- [ ] Who won the election?

## Party Status at End

## Session Metadata

**Character Developments:**
- Milo: Got a pirate hat, marked the mysterious island on the treasure map, sent Tock to scout ahead
- Modred: Used intimidation tactics to get better price for moonstone
- Jaspar: Showed compassion by putting flotation devices on frozen pirates; ironically the rogue was the one spotted by the dragon
- Auren: Demonstrated acrobatic excellence with Misty Step and anchor climbing; outran the dragon's notice

**Mechanical Notes:**
- Auren's Misty Step was key to accessing the frozen ship
- Jaspar failed his stealth check against the dragon
- Milo succeeded on stealth despite following after Jaspar's failed attempt
- The freeze wave was a environmental hazard that destroyed property
