# Session 17: The Masquerade Ball

![[Pasted image 20260115022730.png]]

**Date:** [[2025-11-26]]
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> After retrieving Tyr's gauntlets from the temple, the party emerged to find Cora waiting with cultists. Following a fierce battle where all four cultists were slain, Cora escaped through a triangular portal. The party rushed to warn Arthur via Sending spell, then attended the Castellers masquerade ball. There, Clover's clever ruse exposed Sebastian's severely corrupted hands, and lip-reading revealed Sebastian and Victor conspiring. Clover's attempt to follow them as a rat ended with a Nat 20 kick that yeeted the druid over the mansion gates.

## Revelations & Lore

- **Gift of Faisten**: Cora named Modred's corruption as the "gift of Faisten"
- **Sebastian's Corruption**: His entire hands are black - far more advanced than Modred's fingertips
- **Sebastian's Travel**: Arrived from Neverwinter impossibly fast (7+ day journey by boat)
- **Castellers Conspiracy**: Victor and Sebastian are working together; something is "downstairs"
- **Daggers of the North**: Arena champions wear patches with "salt" symbol from Daggerford

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] What is "downstairs" at House Castellers?
- [ ] How did Sebastian travel so fast?
- [ ] What is the "gift of Faisten"?
- [ ] What is the salt symbol on Daggers of the North patches?
- [ ] Did Arthur escape safely?

## Party Status at End

**Location:** Party split - Clover outside mansion gates (transformed back from rat amid panicking bystanders), others inside masquerade
**Condition:** Mostly healthy after short rest and healing potions
**Next Steps:** Reunite with Clover; investigate what's "downstairs" at House Castellers

## Session Metadata

**Character Developments:**
- Milo: Supported Clover's infiltration with Prestidigitation (fart sounds) and Chronal Shift
- Modred: Corruption recognized by Cora; communicated with Arthur via Sending
- Jaspar: Explored mingling with noble women at the masquerade
- Clover: Cleverly exposed Sebastian's corruption; failed infiltration attempt with comedic conclusion

**Mechanical Notes:**
- Modred took 31 necrotic damage from cultist's critical hit (Inflict Wounds)
- Milo used Chronal Shift twice (once on Cora's Tasha's save, once on Clover's stealth)
- Clover rolled two 3s on stealth despite Chronal Shift
- Guard rolled Natural 20 on unarmed strike, yeeting rat-Clover over the mansion gate
- Party gained boon from Tharizdun - can sacrifice HP to heal others (transfers negative conditions)
