# The Masquerade Ball

![[attachments/session17.png]]

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> After retrieving [[Tyrs_Gauntlets|Tyr's gauntlets]] from the temple, the party emerged to find [[Cora]] waiting with cultists. Following a fierce battle where all four cultists were slain, [[Cora]] escaped through a triangular portal. The party rushed to warn [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur]] via [[Sending_Stones|Sending]] spell, then attended the Castellers masquerade ball. There, [[Clover]]'s clever ruse exposed [[Sebastian]]'s severely corrupted hands, and lip-reading revealed [[Sebastian]] and [[Victor_Castellers|Victor]] conspiring. [[Clover]]'s attempt to follow them as a rat ended with a Nat 20 kick that yeeted the druid over the mansion gates.

## Revelations & Lore

- **Gift of Faisten**: [[Cora]] named [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s corruption as the "gift of Faisten"
- **[[Sebastian]]'s Corruption**: His entire hands are black - far more advanced than [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s fingertips
- **[[Sebastian]]'s Travel**: Arrived from [[Neverwinter]] impossibly fast (7+ day journey by boat)
- **Castellers Conspiracy**: [[Victor_Castellers|Victor]] and [[Sebastian]] are working together; something is "downstairs"
- **[[Daggers_of_the_North]]**: Arena champions wear patches with "salt" symbol from [[Daggerford]]

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] What is "downstairs" at [[House_Castellers]]?
- [ ] How did [[Sebastian]] travel so fast?
- [ ] What is the "gift of Faisten"?
- [ ] What is the salt symbol on [[Daggers_of_the_North]] patches?
- [ ] Did [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur]] escape safely?

## Party Status at End

**Location:** Party split - [[Clover]] outside mansion gates (transformed back from rat amid panicking bystanders), others inside masquerade
**Condition:** Mostly healthy after short rest and healing potions
**Next Steps:** Reunite with [[Clover]]; investigate what's "downstairs" at [[House_Castellers]]

## Session Metadata

- [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]]: Explored mingling with noble women at the masquerade
- [[Clover]]: Cleverly exposed [[Sebastian]]'s corruption; failed infiltration attempt with comedic conclusion

**Mechanical Notes:**
- [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] took 31 necrotic damage from cultist's critical hit (Inflict Wounds)

- Guard rolled Natural 20 on unarmed strike, yeeting rat-[[Clover]] over the mansion gate
- Party gained boon from [[Tharizdun]] - can sacrifice HP to heal others (transfers negative conditions)
