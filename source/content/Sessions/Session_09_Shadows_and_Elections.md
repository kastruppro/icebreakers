# Shadows and Elections

**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]]
**Note:** Auren is no longer part of the campaign as of this session.

## Quick Summary
> The party recovered in Phandalin after their void ordeal, where Jaspar revealed his Aasimar nature. They rescued Arthur De Moray from Cora in the forest, learning he has gaps in his memory and was involved in investigating a cult with his father. In Neverwinter, they witnessed Sebastian using powerful chronurgy magic to restore the castle and discovered he won the re-election by a suspicious landslide. At the House of Knowledge, Gearwhistle agreed to investigate Sebastian and attempted to remove a curse from Arthur, releasing a shadow entity that emerged from his body.
