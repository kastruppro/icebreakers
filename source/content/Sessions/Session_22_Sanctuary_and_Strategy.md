# Sanctuary and Strategy

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> After escaping House Castellers with Thistle and the children, the party regrouped to plan Lord Neverember's rescue. Thistle revealed cultists were seeking "Thassa" and spellcasters who could "bind someone." Modred received an urgent divine warning from Tyr about Tharizdun's acceleration. The party learned Godwin De Moray visited the Temple of Tyr sober, asking for his son. After strategic planning with Ammalia and Raenar, the party rested and leveled to 6, preparing for a 4am assault on the Castellers basement.

## Important Quotes

> "I don't know about the artifact. Everything went so fast. Suddenly, there were cultists everywhere. But I did hear, as they captured me, that they were looking for Thassa and they were looking for strong spellcasters that could bind someone." - Thistle

> "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. Things are happening. Things are being put in process. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world." - Tyr to Modred

> "I also feel something is happening within the walls of Waterdeep. Great power is coming from somewhere." - Tyr

> "Your dad was here some days ago. He asked for you specifically... He was sober. Didn't look good, but he was sober." - Morgane to Modred

> "Last time I went to see him, he tried to kill me." - Modred about Godwin

> "Have you ever met someone where your entire life just revolves around them? I haven't really been by myself like this, so I don't know what to do." - Ammalia

> "With our parents gone, the role falls to us. I will teach you the ways. I promise." - Clover to Thistle

## Revelations & Lore

- **Cultist Objectives:** Thistle overheard cultists seeking "Thassa" and wanting spellcasters who could "bind someone"
- **Divine Warning:** Tyr confirmed "great power" emanating from somewhere in Waterdeep beyond the Castellers situation
- **Tharizdun's Acceleration:** The Betrayer God is "moving fast in the shadows" - time is running out
- **Godwin's Change:** Modred's father visited the Temple of Tyr sober and asked to see his son - unprecedented behavior
- **Sebastian's Corruption:** His hand is confirmed black, like Modred's blackened fingers but further advanced
- **Victor's Secrecy:** Always wore gloves; Ammalia hadn't been intimate with him in a long time

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] Lord Neverember imprisoned in active Tharizdun ritual - rescue at 4am
- [ ] What/who is "Thassa" that cultists were seeking?
- [ ] What binding ritual requires "strong spellcasters"?
- [ ] Temple ruins south of Daggerford - Tyr's primary mission still incomplete
- [ ] Sebastian's corruption and role in the conspiracy
- [ ] "Great power" Tyr sensed in Waterdeep - source unknown
- [ ] Godwin's request to see Modred - will Modred meet him?
- [ ] Mysterious shrine/chest contents - still locked
- [ ] The "four princes" of Tharizdun - identity unknown
- [ ] Ammalia's future now that Victor is gone

## Session Metadata

**Character Developments:**
- **Milo:** Demonstrated tactical intelligence sharing basement intel; bluntly honest about risks ("I rather he die than me"); awkward but well-meaning with Thistle
- **Modred:** Deepening relationship with Tyr despite never being religious; conflicted about meeting his father who once tried to kill him; dark humor about the Castellers children
- **Jaspar:** Smoothed over social situations (rolled 23 performance); preferred comfortable tavern bed over temple floor; began multiclassing into Artificer
- **Clover:** Finally processed grief with Thistle; accepted responsibility as Protector of the Moonlit Pool; protective sister mode activated when Milo introduced himself to Thistle

**Mechanical Notes:**
- Modred rolled 3 on intimidation - children laughed at him
- Jaspar rolled 23 on performance to smooth over the street scene
- Clover rolled d20 to "let Tyr decide" timing (rolled 3, below 10 = go immediately, but party chose rest anyway)
- Party leveled to 6:
  - Clover gained Giant Constrictor Snake wild shape
  - Modred considering Intelligence increase for spell save DC
  - Jaspar multiclassing into Artificer
