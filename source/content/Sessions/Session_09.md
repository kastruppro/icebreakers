# Shadows and Elections

**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]]
**Note:** [[Auren]] is no longer part of the campaign as of this session.

## Quick Summary
> The party recovered in [[Phandalin]] after their void ordeal, where [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] revealed his Aasimar nature. They rescued [[Arthur_De_Moray]] from [[Cora]] in the forest, learning he has gaps in his memory and was involved in investigating a cult with his father. In [[Neverwinter]], they witnessed [[Sebastian]] using powerful chronurgy magic to restore the castle and discovered he won the re-election by a suspicious landslide. At the [[House_of_Knowledge]], Gearwhistle agreed to investigate [[Sebastian]] and attempted to remove a curse from [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur]], releasing a shadow entity that emerged from his body.
