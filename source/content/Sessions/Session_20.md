# Into The Dream

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

![[attachments/session20.png]]
## Quick Summary
> The party returned to [[Waterdeep]] from [[Daggerford]], planning their infiltration of [[House_Castellers]]. When [[Ammalia_Castellers]] psychically attacked [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] to retrieve her stolen spellbook, a chase ensued that led to unexpected negotiations. [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia]] revealed that [[Victor_Castellers|Victor]] made a deal with a demon and their children fell into an eternal slumber as payment. She agreed to help the party access the mansion in exchange for help rescuing her children. Using the [[Dream_Staff]] from [[Desna]], the party entered [[Thistle]]'s nightmare and navigated a series of puzzles involving colored teddy bears and lying jesters before confronting a monstrous dream-beast possessing [[Clover]]'s sister.
