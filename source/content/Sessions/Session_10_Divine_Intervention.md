# Session 10: Divine Intervention

**Date:** [[2025-09-17]]
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party battled a shadow entity possessing Arthur in the Chapel of Oghma, with a new ally Clover joining the fight. After subduing the shadow, Milo received divine favor directly from Oghma himself, gaining the Fey Touched feat. The party then reunited with Milo's family, learning crucial information about their grandfather's research into the cult and the mechanics of void portals.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Clover]]** - Harengon Male - Moon Druid (NEW PC). A small Harengon with drooped ears who wandered through a portal from the Feywild. His family protects the Moonwell Pool. Joined the party during the shadow fight.

- **[[Ren Swiftclock]]** - Harengon Male - Milo's father. Master horologist who runs a prestigious clock workshop in Neverwinter.

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Arthur De Moray]]** - Shadow entity emerged fully; Modred dragged him into light to suppress it. Entity declared him "a fine vessel for Tharizdun."
- **[[Master Tiberius Gearwhistle]]** - Confirmed the shadow is abnormally tethered to Arthur.
- **[[Oghma]]** - Appeared directly to Milo in a divine throne room, granting him Fey Touched despite celestial rules forbidding direct intervention.

- **Void Portal Mechanics**:
  - Speaking destination aloud directs the portal
  - Proper preparation provides protection during transit
  - Repeated exposure to the Void causes madness
