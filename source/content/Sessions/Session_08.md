# [[The_Chained]] Released

**Date:** 2024-XX-XX
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]], [[Auren]]

## Quick Summary
> The party faced ice elementals and skeletons on the [[Mountain_Top|mountain]] summit, with [[Auren]] removing a corrupted gem from the hammer to end the freeze wave. [[Cora]] escaped after declaring "[[The_Chained|the chained]] one has been released." [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] reunited with his freed sister [[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora]], who revealed she had followed their parents' research and was betrayed by [[Cora]]. On the descent, the party encountered a [[White_Dragon|white dragon]] who made them his "servants." Back in [[Phandalin]], [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] learned from [[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora]] about a Great House in [[Waterdeep]] that knows about [[The_Chained|the Chained]], and [[Oghma]] appeared to [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] in a dream-vision.
