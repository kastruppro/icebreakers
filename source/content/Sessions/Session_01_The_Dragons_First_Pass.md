# The Dragon's First Pass

**Date:** Unknown
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], Auren Thalos (Eladrin Sorcerer), "Isak" (Reborn Paladin)

## Quick Summary
> Four adventurers arrived separately in the frontier town of Phandalin just as an ancient white dragon attacked, freezing citizens in magical ice. After the chaos subsided, the party united to investigate, ultimately negotiating peace between dwarves and orcs at a nearby digging site before learning about a potential way to defeat the dragon through an orcish thunderbear ritual.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Toblen]]** - Human Male - Mayor of Phandalin, runs the tavern. Offered the party lodging and wine.
- **[[Sister Gale]]** - Half-Elf Female - Cleric of Tymora at the Shrine of Luck. Attempted to dispel the ice magic but failed.
- **[[Norbus]]** - Dwarf Male - Friend of Toblen who works at the digging site. Wanted to check on Axeholm.
- **[[Grom]]** - Dwarf Male - Leader of the Digging Site. Negotiating with orcs over territory.
- **[[Krikk]]** - Orc Male - Leader of the Gundrak orc settlement. Made peace with dwarves; mentioned thunderbear ritual to Talos.
- **[[Erik (Phandalin)]]** - Human Male - Toblen's nephew. Delivered Milo's letters to Neverwinter.
