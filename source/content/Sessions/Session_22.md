# Sanctuary and Strategy

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> After escaping [[House_Castellers]] with [[Thistle]] and the children, the party regrouped to plan [[Lord_Neverember]]'s rescue. [[Thistle]] revealed cultists were seeking "Thassa" and spellcasters who could "bind someone." [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] received an urgent divine warning from Tyr about [[Tharizdun]]'s acceleration. The party learned [[Godwin_De_Moray]] visited the Temple of Tyr sober, asking for his son. After strategic planning with [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia]] and [[Raenar_Neverember|Raenar]], the party rested and leveled to 6, preparing for a 4am assault on the Castellers basement.

## Revelations & Lore

- **Cultist Objectives:** [[Thistle]] overheard cultists seeking "Thassa" and wanting spellcasters who could "bind someone"
- **Divine Warning:** Tyr confirmed "great power" emanating from somewhere in [[Waterdeep]] beyond the Castellers situation
- **[[Tharizdun]]'s Acceleration:** The Betrayer God is "moving fast in the shadows" - time is running out
- **[[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin]]'s Change:** [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s father visited the Temple of Tyr sober and asked to see his son - unprecedented behavior
- **[[Sebastian]]'s Corruption:** His hand is confirmed black, like [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s blackened fingers but further advanced
- **[[Victor_Castellers|Victor]]'s Secrecy:** Always wore gloves; [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia]] hadn't been intimate with him in a long time

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] [[Lord_Neverember]] imprisoned in active [[Tharizdun]] ritual - rescue at 4am
- [ ] What/who is "Thassa" that cultists were seeking?
- [ ] What binding ritual requires "strong spellcasters"?
- [ ] Temple ruins south of [[Daggerford]] - [[Tyrs_Divine_Workshop|Tyr's]] primary mission still incomplete
- [ ] [[Sebastian]]'s corruption and role in the conspiracy
- [ ] "Great power" Tyr sensed in [[Waterdeep]] - source unknown
- [ ] [[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin]]'s request to see [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] - will [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] meet him?
- [ ] [[Mysterious_Shrine_Chest|Mysterious]] shrine/chest contents - still locked
- [ ] The "four princes" of [[Tharizdun]] - identity unknown

## Session Metadata

**Character Developments:**
- **[[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]]:** Demonstrated tactical intelligence sharing basement intel; bluntly honest about risks ("I rather he die than me"); awkward but well-meaning with [[Thistle]]
- **[[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]:** Deepening relationship with Tyr despite never being religious; conflicted about meeting his father who once tried to kill him; dark humor about the Castellers children
- **[[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]]:** Smoothed over social situations (rolled 23 performance); preferred comfortable tavern bed over temple floor; began multiclassing into Artificer
- **[[Clover]]:** Finally processed grief with [[Thistle]]; accepted responsibility as Protector of the Moonlit Pool; protective sister mode activated when [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] introduced himself to [[Thistle]]

**Mechanical Notes:**
- [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] rolled 3 on intimidation - children laughed at him
- [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] rolled 23 on performance to smooth over the street scene
- [[Clover]] rolled d20 to "let Tyr decide" timing (rolled 3, below 10 = go immediately, but party chose rest anyway)
- Party leveled to 6:
  - [[Clover]] gained Giant Constrictor Snake wild shape
  - [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] considering Intelligence increase for spell save DC
  - [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] multiclassing into Artificer
