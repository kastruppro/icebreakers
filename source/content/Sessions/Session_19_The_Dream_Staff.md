# The Dream Staff

**Date:** [[2025-12-17]]
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party awoke at the Sated Satyr Inn after the masquerade, compared notes with the Daggers of the North about their shared cult investigation, learned about the Temple of Desna in Daggerford, traveled there via Clover's warhorse form, and met the goddess Desna herself who granted them the Dream Staff to enter Thistle's nightmare and free her from Tharizdun's spell.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Moguna]]** - Elf Female - Paladin, leader of the Daggers of the North. Trusting and open, suggested the Temple of Desna. "If magic is not working, maybe this temple can help you in some way."
- **[[Leena]]** - Dwarf Female - Druid of the Daggers of the North. Suspicious and protective, drew her axe when Clover cast Guidance. Thinks Moguna is too naive.
- **[[Merin]]** - Tabaxi Male - Rogue of the Daggers of the North. Cautious, uncertain if the party can be trusted.
- **[[Rafael]]** - Human Male - Warlock of the Daggers of the North (deceased). Had nightmares about chains and a demon. Killed fighting a beast in the marsh near Daggerford.
- **[[Desna]]** - Goddess - Goddess of Dreams, Nightmares, Stars, and Luck. Appeared as constellation face with starry cloud hair. Granted the Dream Staff to Clover.
- **[[Temple Priest (Desna)]]** - Unknown Female - Priest at Temple of Desna. Purple robes with glowing moon symbol on hands. No hierarchy in the temple.

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Raenar Neverember]]** - Still at the Sated Satyr, ate a pepper nut and turned invisible. Party promised to return for drinks.
- **[[Isabella Adabrent]]** - Sent Jaspar a pink perfumed note and pepper nuts thanking him for the dance. Guards at House Adabrent wouldn't let party in.

## Important Quotes

> "The kids appears indeed to be in some sort of trance. And there is another creature involved in this ritual - a creature which is not from this plane of existence." - Modred, explaining to the Daggers

> "Rafael our friend had a lot of nightmares about chains and some weird demon." - Moguna, about their fallen companion

> "This staff you can use to enter the dreams, the nightmares of your sister and hopefully free her that way. However, there is a price... If you fail in the dream, it is impossible to get out." - Desna

> "Whatever the price is, I'm willing to pay it." - Clover

> "The whole fate of the world lies in all of your hands. No pressure." - Desna

> "Cora's dreams are full of destruction. Hate." - Desna, reading the dreams of the party's enemy

## Revelations & Lore

- Thistle is under a spell cast by Tharizdun himself - no mortal magic can wake her
- The Dream Staff can enter the dreams/nightmares of those under Tharizdun's spell, but failure means being trapped forever
- There are cult ruins in the marsh south of Daggerford containing one of Tharizdun's chains
- Tyr's gauntlets have power to destroy Tharizdun's chains
- Desna confirmed Cora's dreams are full of destruction and hate - essentially irredeemable
- Raenar's dreams are about reuniting with his father (innocent)
- Modred's father Godwin dreams of guilt, hatred, and shame
- Jaspar's prophetic dreams exist in a crossover between dreams and something else - even Desna cannot control them

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] Use Dream Staff to enter Thistle's nightmare and free her
- [ ] Infiltrate House Castellers to reach Thistle
- [ ] Explore the cult ruins in the marsh near Daggerford
- [ ] Find and destroy more of Tharizdun's chains using Tyr's gauntlets
- [ ] Jaspar needs to properly meet with Isabella Adabrent
- [ ] Modred wants to visit his father Godwin again

## Party Status at End

**Location:** Temple of Desna, Daggerford (planning to return to Waterdeep)
**Condition:** Fully rested (received long rest from temple meditation)
**Next Steps:** Infiltrate House Castellers using rooftop approach and Milo's teleportation, with Daggers of the North creating a distraction. Use Dream Staff to free Thistle from her nightmare.
