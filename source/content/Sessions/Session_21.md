**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party defeated the elemental chimera-beast in the [[Dream_Realm|dream realm]] by exploiting its adaptive nature with cold damage. [[Thistle]] was freed from her trance, but the party had to flee [[House_Castellers]] as [[Victor_Castellers|Victor]] arrived. [[Victor_Castellers|Victor]] was claimed by [[Tharizdun]] through a triangular portal, while [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] discovered [[Lord_Neverember]] chained in a basement ritual. The party escaped with the Castellers children and a [[Mysterious_Shrine_Chest|mysterious shrine chest]].
