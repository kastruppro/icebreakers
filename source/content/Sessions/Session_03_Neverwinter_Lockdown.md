# [[Neverwinter]] Lockdown

**Date:** 2024-02-07
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Auren]] (former party member), [[Jaspar Starshade]] (first meeting)

## Quick Summary
> The party arrived at [[Neverwinter]] to find the city in crisis - the ice dragon had frozen citizens in time. After meeting the silver-haired rogue [[Jaspar_Starshade]] at the [[Moonstone_Mask]], they joined a search party for the missing [[Lord_Neverember]]. At [[Neverwinter_Castle]], they battled ice skeletons to protect the partially-frozen lord, only to watch helplessly as he fell through a collapsing floor and was swallowed by a [[Mysterious_Shrine_Chest|mysterious]] portal. In the castle's basement, they discovered the screaming ghosts of the Guardians of Nine.
