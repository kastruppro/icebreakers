# The Masquerade Heist

**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party continued infiltrating the Castellers' masquerade ball after Clover was kicked out as a rat. While Jaspar gathered intelligence from nobles and Modred spoke with the Daggers of the North, Clover snuck back in as a cat and discovered his sister Thistle floating in a trance, channeling magic into two sleeping children. The party attempted to rescue her but Protection from Evil and Good, Dispel Magic, and Identify all failed. After fighting an animated armor guardian, they escaped with a powerful spellbook but left Thistle behind.

- Thistle appears to be channeling something into or from the children (trance magic affecting consciousness)
- Neither Protection from Evil and Good, Dispel Magic, nor Identify work on Thistle's condition - this is unknown magic
- The Daggers of the North also encountered the black corruption substance in Daggerford
- The docks of Waterdeep operate semi-lawlessly, controlled by noble houses
- Necromantic magic detected on the second floor of House Castellers
- Isabel's house controls Waterdeep's docks; she's gullible and became smitten with Jaspar
