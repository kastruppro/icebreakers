# The [[Dream_Staff]]

**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Party Present:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]], [[Clover]]

## Quick Summary
> The party awoke at the [[Sated_Satyr_Inn]] after the masquerade, compared notes with the [[Daggers_of_the_North]] about their shared cult investigation, learned about the [[Temple_of_Desna]] in [[Daggerford]], traveled there via [[Clover]]'s warhorse form, and met the goddess [[Desna]] herself who granted them the [[Dream_Staff]] to enter [[Thistle]]'s nightmare and free her from [[Tharizdun]]'s spell.

## Characters Met

### New NPCs
- **[[Morguna]]** - Elf Female - Paladin, leader of the [[Daggers_of_the_North]]. Trusting and open, suggested the [[Temple_of_Desna]]. "If magic is not working, maybe this temple can help you in some way."
- **[[Leena]]** - Dwarf Female - Druid of the [[Daggers_of_the_North]]. Suspicious and protective, drew her axe when [[Clover]] cast Guidance. Thinks Moguna is too naive.
- **[[Merin]]** - Tabaxi Male - Rogue of the [[Daggers_of_the_North]]. Cautious, uncertain if the party can be trusted.
- **[[Rafael]]** - Human Male - Warlock of the [[Daggers_of_the_North]] (deceased). Had nightmares about chains and a demon. Killed fighting a beast in the marsh near [[Daggerford]].
- **[[Desna]]** - Goddess - Goddess of Dreams, Nightmares, Stars, and Luck. Appeared as constellation face with starry cloud hair. Granted the [[Dream_Staff]] to [[Clover]].
- **[[Desna|Temple Priest]]** - Unknown Female - Priest at [[Temple_of_Desna]]. Purple robes with glowing moon symbol on hands. No hierarchy in the temple.

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Raenar_Neverember|Raenar Neverember]]** - Still at the Sated Satyr, ate a [[Pepper_Nuts|pepper]] nut and turned invisible. Party promised to return for drinks.
- **[[Isabella_Adabrent|Isabella Adabrent]]** - Sent [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] a pink perfumed note and [[Pepper_Nuts|pepper nuts]] thanking him for the dance. Guards at [[House_Adabrent]] wouldn't let party in.

## Important Quotes

> "The kids appears indeed to be in some sort of trance. And there is another creature involved in this ritual - a creature which is not from this plane of existence." - [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]], explaining to the [[Daggers_of_the_North|Daggers]]

> "[[Rafael]] our friend had a lot of nightmares about chains and some weird demon." - Moguna, about their fallen companion

> "This staff you can use to enter the dreams, the nightmares of your sister and hopefully free her that way. However, there is a price... If you fail in the dream, it is impossible to get out." - [[Desna]]

> "Whatever the price is, I'm willing to pay it." - [[Clover]]

> "The whole fate of the world lies in all of your hands. No pressure." - [[Desna]]

> "[[Cora]]'s dreams are full of destruction. Hate." - [[Desna]], reading the dreams of the party's enemy

## Revelations & Lore

- The [[Dream_Staff]] can enter the dreams/nightmares of those under [[Tharizdun]]'s spell, but failure means being trapped forever
- There are cult ruins in the marsh south of [[Daggerford]] containing one of [[Tharizdun]]'s chains
- [[Tyrs_Gauntlets|Tyr's gauntlets]] have power to destroy [[Tharizdun]]'s chains
- [[Desna]] confirmed [[Cora]]'s dreams are full of destruction and hate - essentially irredeemable
- [[Raenar_Neverember|Raenar]]'s dreams are about reuniting with his father (innocent)
- [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s father [[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin]] dreams of guilt, hatred, and shame
- [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]]'s prophetic dreams exist in a crossover between dreams and something else - even [[Desna]] cannot control them

**Next Steps:** Infiltrate [[House_Castellers]] using rooftop approach and [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]]'s teleportation, with [[Daggers_of_the_North]] creating a distraction. Use [[Dream_Staff]] to free [[Thistle]] from her nightmare.
