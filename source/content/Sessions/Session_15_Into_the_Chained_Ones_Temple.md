# Into the Chained One's Temple

**Date:** [[2025-10-30]]
**Party Present:** [[Milo Swiftclock]], [[Sir Modred De Moray]], [[Clover]] (Jaspar absent - working with [[Gigz]])

## Quick Summary
> The party ventured to the Tharizdun cult ruins in the forest outside Waterdeep as a "warm up" before the masquerade ball. After activating a blood-sealed elevator with Modred's sacrifice, they descended into a massive underground temple dominated by a giant statue of the Chained One. In the well chamber, they faced a brutal chain puzzle that required defeating waves of regenerating oozes while securing chains to hooks. The final battle against a large Oblex that created a perfect magical duplicate of Milo pushed the party to their limits, but they emerged victorious with the mechanism activated and more dungeon awaiting.

## Characters Met

### Returning NPCs
- **[[Statue Square Guard]]** - Human Male - City guard posted to warn pilgrims away from the forest. Recognized Modred and reminded him about his father's failed expedition with Arthur to these same ruins.

## Important Quotes

> "Good warm up before going to the party and trash it." - Modred, on fighting cultists before the masquerade

> "I have so good history with being stealthy." - Milo, sarcastically

## Revelations & Lore

- Blood sacrifice required for entry to Tharizdun's temple
- Temple guards something with chain mechanism (likely Tyr's Gauntlets)
- Ooze guardians regenerate when killed - require strategic containment
- Large Oblex-type oozes can create perfect duplicates of party members, including spellcasting abilities
- Modred's father and Arthur previously attempted to reach these ruins and failed
- Chain mechanism requires securing all chains while fighting off guardians

## Unresolved Threads

- [ ] What was raised from the well depths?
- [ ] Are Tyr's Gauntlets finally within reach?
- [ ] Can the party recover resources before the masquerade?
- [ ] Will the oozes regenerate again in future rooms?
- [ ] What other puzzles await deeper in the temple?

## Party Status at End

**Location:** Temple of Tharizdun, well chamber
**Condition:** Resources depleted from extended ooze combat, Jaspar absent
**Next Steps:** Explore what the chain mechanism revealed, claim potential prize, attend masquerade ball tonight

## Session Metadata

**Character Developments:**
- Milo: Used Tock effectively for scouting, showed tactical thinking with Mirror Image against his duplicate, reluctant about blood sacrifice due to fur concerns
- Modred: Voluntarily shed blood for altar activation, reminded of family tragedy in these ruins, continuing to fight through personal connection to this location
- Clover: Used nature expertise to identify animal activity at clearing, participated fully in chain puzzle combat
- Jaspar: Absent - working with Gigz on devices in Waterdeep

**Mechanical Notes:**
- Clover rolled 22 on Nature check to identify bear activity
- Multiple waves of combat with regenerating oozes
- Milo's Mirror Image proved crucial against the Oblex duplicate
- Extended dungeon crawl with resource attrition
- Puzzle mechanics required coordination and strategic thinking
