## Description
Mother of [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]] and [[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora Swiftclock]]. Wife of [[Ren_Swiftclock|Ren Swiftclock]]. The keeper of the Swiftclock family's secret research into the cult of Tharizdun.

## Personality

  - Milo's grandfather went through a portal and never returned
  - Void portal mechanics (speaking destination, need for protection, madness from overuse)
  - Confirmed Tharizdun is the Chained One
