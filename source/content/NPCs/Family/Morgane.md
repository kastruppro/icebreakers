# Morgane

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Female
**Role:** Modred's Mother, Priestess of Tyr
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[House_of_Justice|Temple of Tyr]] (Waterdeep)

## Description
Left Godwin (Modred's father) years ago. Now serves as a priestess at the Temple of Tyr in Waterdeep. A capable healer who can perform magical examinations to detect corruption and curse effects.

## Personality
Caring and practical. Maintains complicated feelings about her former husband Godwin - she warns Modred about him but also reports when Godwin reaches out. Takes her role as priestess seriously and provides sanctuary to those in need.

## Important Quotes
> "Arthur possessed, your father mad... both my sons leaving broke him completely." - Session 9

> "Your dad was here some days ago. He asked for you specifically... I'm not saying you should go. I know how he can be when he starts drinking a lot. It might be a trick. But he was sober when he came. Didn't look good, but he was sober. He really wanted to talk with you." - Session 22, to Modred

## History with Party
- **Session 13**: Reunited with Modred at Temple of Tyr. Gave divine quest from Tyr.
- **Session 17**: Gave party 3 healing potions.
- **Session 22**: When the party arrived with Thistle, the Castellers children, and Ammalia, Morgane immediately helped. She performed a magical examination on Thistle (hands glowing with light) and confirmed no corruption or magical damage. She arranged care for the children and Thistle. Pulled Modred aside to reveal that Godwin had visited the temple while sober, specifically asking for his son.

## Key Information
- Provides divine connection to **Tyr**
- Left Modred's father Godwin due to his descent into madness
- Can help with healing, divine guidance, and detecting magical corruption
- Currently caring for Thistle, the Castellers children, and Ammalia at the temple

## Session 22 Details
Morgane performed a thorough magical examination on Thistle, her hands emanating light as she checked for any demonic or magical corruption from the cultist captivity. After one or two minutes, she concluded that Thistle appeared completely unharmed - no physical damage, no magical effects, nothing within her.

She also revealed crucial information about Godwin: he had visited the Temple of Tyr some days earlier, while sober (a rarity), and specifically asked for Modred. She noted he "didn't look good" but was clearly making an effort. She left the decision to meet him up to Modred, acknowledging their complicated history.
