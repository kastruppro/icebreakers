# Liora Swiftclock

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Harengon Female
**Role:** Milo's Younger Sister, Prophet
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[Neverwinter]] (Swiftclock Family Home)

## Description
A 22-year-old harengon with adventurous spirit and prophetic abilities. Liora has always been headstrong and empathetic, drawn to stories, dreams, and omens rather than the structured life of her clockmaker family.

## Personality
Adventurous, headstrong, and deeply empathetic. While Milo seeks answers in logic and theory, Liora chases them through visions and instinct. Her prophetic visions have driven her to make dangerous choices.

## Key Quotes
> "Do not trust the shadow, trust that I know best. I beg of you not to go look for me. If you find me, do not free me, for it will mean the end, the chained released." - Cryptic note

> "A time will come when you have to choose between family and power. If you're not ready, it will be the end of the world." - Session 11 prophecy to Clover
