# Ammalia Castellers

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Female
**Role:** Lady of House Castellers
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[House Castellers]] (Waterdeep)

## Description
Wife of Victor Castellers and mother to their two children. Appears to have been unaware of (or unwilling participant in) the full extent of Victor's dealings with Tharizdun. Grateful to the party for saving her children, devastated by Victor being claimed.

## Personality
Protective of her children. Showed genuine grief when Victor was taken. Helpful to the party after they saved her children, providing information and access to the hidden room. May have been complicit in some of Victor's activities but unclear to what extent.

> "Victor told me he was visited by a demon who told him that in exchange for gaining more power, we would have to make a deal. But the deal would come at a later point." - Session 20

> "I don't know how to get them back. I just want my spellbook back. If I could help you, I would." - Session 20

> "Have you ever met someone where your entire life just revolves around them? I haven't really been by myself like this, so I don't know what to do." - Session 22

## History with Party
- **Session 17**: Present at masquerade ball at House Castellers (no direct interaction)
- **Session 21**: Her voice echoed through the dream realm warning "Victor is coming." Witnessed Victor being claimed by Tharizdun. Thanked Milo for saving her children. Revealed information about Victor's deal with "the four princes." Accompanied Milo to the hidden room behind the painting in the study. Left behind in Waterdeep.

## Key Information Provided (Session 21)
- Victor made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun
- The deal somehow involved their children
- When the children were rescued (deal broken), Tharizdun claimed Victor
- Tried to touch the chains dragging Victor but was burned
- Showed Milo the hidden room behind the painting (accessed via floor-level pressure plate)
- Claimed the glass containers on the shelf were just "music-playing glasses" (they detected as slightly magical)

## Current Situation
Left alone in Waterdeep after Victor was claimed. Her children were rescued by the party but are currently with the The Icebreakers, not with her. Her fate and future role are uncertain - she may become an ally, informant, or could have divided loyalties.

## Unanswered Questions
- How much did she know about Victor's dealings with Tharizdun?
- Was she willingly complicit or kept in the dark?
- Will she want her children back?
- Does she know more about the ritual in the basement?
