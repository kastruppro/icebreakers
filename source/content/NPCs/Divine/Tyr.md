## Description
Tyr, the God of Justice, appears to mortals through the form of a black hound - a divine avatar that allows him to communicate with and guide the party.

## Boon of Tyr
Granted to entire party:

> "Use the gauntlets to set Tharizdun further back into the world and the party will succeed." - Session 16

> "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. Things are happening. Things are being put in process. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world." - Session 22

> "I also feel something is happening within the walls of Waterdeep. Great power is coming from somewhere." - Session 22
