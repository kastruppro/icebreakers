# Godwin De Moray

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Male
**Role:** Patriarch of House De Moray, Modred's Father
**Status:** Alive (Mentally Unstable)
**Current Location:** [[Waterdeep]] (House De Moray)

## Description
A broken shell of a noble patriarch. Once a powerful figure in House De Moray, Godwin has fallen into severe depression and alcoholism. Unkempt beard, unwashed, surrounded by empty bottles, giving off a foul smell.

## Personality
Consumed by guilt, hatred, and shame. His mental state has rendered him unstable and dangerous. When the party visited, he attacked them with Wall of Fire rather than engage in conversation.

## Important Quotes
> "I have no son. My son is gone. Leave." - Session 12, to Modred

## History with Party
- **Session 12**: Party visited House De Moray in Waterdeep. Found Godwin in his deteriorated state. He attacked them with Wall of Fire when Milo tried to introduce the party.

## Mental State (Revealed by Desna)
Godwin's dreams are full of:
- **Guilt**: Something he has done haunts him
- **Hatred**: Directed at himself or others
- **Shame**: The De Moray legacy carries terrible weight

## Family Tragedy
- [[Modred De Moray]] left home years ago
- [[Arthur De Moray]] was possessed by a shadow entity after Godwin took him to investigate the cult
- His wife [[Morgane]] left him for the House of Justice
- He "lost both his sons" and spiraled into madness

## Connections
- [[Modred De Moray]] - Son (party member, estranged)
- [[Arthur De Moray]] - Son (possessed)
- [[Morgane]] - Ex-wife, now priestess of Tyr
- [[Sebastian]] - Both show signs of corruption (possible connection?)
