# Lord Neverember

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Male
**Role:** Former Open Lord of Waterdeep, Raenar's Father
**Status:** Imprisoned - ACTIVE RITUAL
**Current Location:** Ritual chamber beneath [[House_Castellers|House Castellers]]

## Description
Powerful noble who previously held significant political power in Waterdeep. Father to Raenar Neverember. Was reported missing after falling through a triangular portal. Now discovered chained in a Tharizdun cult ritual circle.

## Current Situation (Session 21 Discovery)
Milo's owl familiar discovered Lord Neverember in the basement of House Castellers. He is:
- **Chained in a summoning circle** in the center of a massive ritual chamber
- Surrounded by **8-10 cloaked cultists** standing in a circle chanting "Tharizdun"
- **Two individuals in earthy clothes with flowers in their hair** (possibly druids) are casting spells on him
- A **giant statue of Tharizdun in chains** looms over the room
- A **pool/basin of water** sits before the statue

The ritual appears to be actively ongoing. His fate if the ritual completes is unknown.

## Background
- Father of [[Raenar_Neverember|Raenar Neverember]] who dreams of being reunited with him
- Was reported to have "fallen through a triangular portal" (similar to the portals used by Tharizdun cultists)
- His disappearance has been a mystery the party learned about earlier in the campaign

## History with Party
- **Earlier sessions**: Mentioned as missing, fell through triangular portal. Raenar searching for him.
- **Session 21**: DISCOVERED. Milo's owl familiar found him chained in the ritual chamber beneath House Castellers. Party did not rescue him due to combat depletion and need to escape.

## Rescue Priority
Lord Neverember's rescue is now a critical quest objective. The party knows:
- Exactly where he is (House Castellers basement)
- He is in active danger (ritual ongoing)
- The ritual involves significant cult presence (8-10 cultists + 2 spell-casters)
- There are multiple basement passages (tomb room, bedroom, ritual chamber)

## Connections
- [[Raenar_Neverember|Raenar Neverember]] - Son (party ally, wants to rescue him)
- [[House_Castellers|House Castellers]] - Imprisoned beneath this estate
- [[Victor_Castellers|Victor Castellers]] - Lord of the house where he's imprisoned (now claimed by Tharizdun)
- [[Tharizdun]] - Target of ritual being performed on him
- [[Cora]] - Uses same triangular portals that took him

## Unanswered Questions
- What is the purpose of the ritual?
- Why was Lord Neverember specifically targeted?
- Who are the two "druids" with flowers in their hair?
- How long has he been imprisoned?
- What happens if the ritual completes?
- Is this connected to his political power or something else?
