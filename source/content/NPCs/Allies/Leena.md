# Leena

![[attachments/leena.png]]
## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Dwarf Female
**Role:** Druid, Daggers of the North Member
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[Waterdeep]]

## Description
A dwarven druid serving with the Daggers of the North. Quick to reach for her axe when she perceives a threat, Leena maintains a vigilant and protective stance over her group, particularly her leader Morguna.

## Personality
Suspicious and protective, Leena serves as the cautious counterbalance to Morguna's trusting nature. She believes her leader is naive in her willingness to share information with strangers. When [[Clover]] cast Guidance during a conversation, Leena immediately drew her axe, demonstrating her hair-trigger defensive instincts. She takes her role as protector seriously.

## Key Quotes
> Drew her axe when Clover cast Guidance - Session 19

## History with Party
- Session 19: First encountered the party alongside [[Morguna]]; immediately drew her axe when [[Clover]] cast Guidance, suspicious of the party's intentions
- Session 20: Last seen in Waterdeep, still wary of the The Icebreakers despite Morguna's alliance

## Connections
- [[Morguna]] - Leader of the Daggers of the North; Leena thinks she is too naive and trusting
- [[Merin]] - Fellow Daggers of the North member
- [[Clover]] - Party member whose spellcasting triggered Leena's defensive response
