# Merin

![[Pasted image 20260115023019.png]]
## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Tabaxi Male
**Role:** Rogue, Daggers of the North Member
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[House Castellers]], [[Waterdeep]] (positioned as lookout)

## Description
A tabaxi rogue operating with the Daggers of the North. Currently positioned inside House Castellers as a lookout, gathering intelligence on the suspicious noble house. His feline features and rogueish skills make him well-suited for infiltration work.

## Personality
Cautious and uncertain, Merin maintains a guarded disposition toward new acquaintances. When [[Milo Swiftclock]] used Detect Thoughts during their meeting, he picked up Merin's internal questioning: "Can we trust these people?" This reflects his careful, analytical approach to potential allies—neither hostile nor welcoming until trust is established.
