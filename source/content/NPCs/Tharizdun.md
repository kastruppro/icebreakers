# Tharizdun

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Betrayer God (Beyond Mortal Understanding)
**Role:** The Chained One, God of Eternal Darkness
**Status:** Imprisoned (Partially - Influence Escaping)
**Current Location:** The Void (Bound by Eight Chains)

## Description
An entity of primordial evil so dangerous that all other gods - both good and evil - united to imprison him. When glimpsed in visions, Tharizdun appears bound by eight massive chains in an endless void, yet his malevolent influence still reaches into the mortal realm.

## Nature
- **The Chained One**: Bound by eight divine chains
- **Betrayer God**: So evil all other gods opposed him
- **Corruption Source**: The blackened hands/fingers of Sebastian and Modred
- **Dream Invader**: Directly cursed [[Thistle]]

## The Eight Chains
Tharizdun is bound by eight chains. [[Tyr]]'s Gauntlets can destroy these chains - which is why the cult and the gods both seek them.

## Cult Activity
An extensive network of followers seeks to free him:
- [[Cora]] - Agent who escapes via triangular portals
- [[Sebastian]] - Severely corrupted (fully black hands)
- [[Victor Castellers]] - Made demon deal, working with cult
- Unknown others infiltrating noble houses

## Connections to Party
- [[Thistle]] - Directly cursed by Tharizdun
- [[Modred De Moray]] - Corruption spreading in fingers
- [[Arthur De Moray]] - Shadow possession linked to him
- [[Jaspar Starshade]] - Prophetic dreams may show his influence

## Connections
- [[Tyr]] - Opposed; gauntlets can destroy chains
- [[Desna]] - Opposed; provided Dream Staff to counter curse
- [[Cora]], [[Sebastian]], [[Victor Castellers]] - Servants
