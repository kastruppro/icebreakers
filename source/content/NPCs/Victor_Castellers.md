# Victor Castellers

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Male
**Role:** Lord of House Castellers
**Status:** Claimed by Tharizdun
**Current Location:** Unknown dimension/realm (taken by Tharizdun)

## Description
Wears a tiara with a **black gem** on his forehead. Noble lord who hosted masquerade balls at House Castellers. Rival to House De Moray. Made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun involving his own children.

## Personality
Cold, disdainful, secretive, desperate. Left the arena without applause when Modred announced the De Moray name. Showed fury when his children were taken from the mansion.

## Key Quotes
> "Just leave the party now and meet me downstairs." - Session 17, to Sebastian (lip-read by Clover)

> "What is going on here? Where are my kids? Where are our kids?" - Session 21, upon finding empty bedroom

> "Thief! Someone get them thieves!" - Session 21, shouting as party escaped

## History with Party
- **Session 13**: Watched arena battle, left when Modred invoked House De Moray name
- **Session 17**: Hosted masquerade ball. Retreated downstairs with Sebastian when "compromised"
- **Session 18**: Party infiltrated his mansion and discovered Thistle
- **Session 21**: Pursued the fleeing party, shot fireballs at them. When the party rescued his children (breaking his deal with Tharizdun), red chains erupted from a circle beneath him and dragged him through a triangular portal. Claimed by Tharizdun.

## The Deal with Tharizdun
Victor made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun. The deal involved his children somehow - their presence was required to maintain it. When the party rescued the children via Vortex Warp, the deal was broken, and Tharizdun claimed Victor as payment. He was dragged through a triangular portal (the same type Cora uses) by burning chains that emerged from a red circle beneath him.

## Known Crimes/Involvement
- Made a deal with Tharizdun's princes
- Children connected to Thistle's magical trance
- Fortune grew suspiciously fast
- Connected to missing children (funding?)
- Conspiring with Sebastian about being "compromised"
- Basement of his mansion contains active Tharizdun cult ritual with Lord Neverember imprisoned
