# Morguna

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Elf Female
**Role:** Paladin, Leader of Daggers of the North
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[Waterdeep]]

## Description
An elven paladin who leads the Daggers of the North, a group investigating cult activity. She and her team wear distinctive salt-symbol patches from Daggerford, marking their affiliation. Carries a vial containing a corruption substance collected during their investigations.

## Personality
Trusting and open, perhaps to a fault according to her companion Leena. Morguna believes in building alliances and sharing information freely with those who seem to oppose the same evils. She takes a collaborative approach to fighting the cult threat, willing to share hard-won intelligence with the party.
