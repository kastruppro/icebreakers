# Thistle

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Harengon Female
**Role:** Clover's Sister, Druid Trainee of the Moonlit Pool
**Status:** Alive - Safe at Temple of Tyr
**Current Location:** [[Temple of Tyr]] (Waterdeep)

## Description
Young Harengon druid, approximately 16 years old. Sister to Clover. Was held captive by House Castellers and placed under a magical trance by Tharizdun. Now freed and reunited with her sibling, processing the trauma of captivity and the revelation that their parents are dead.

## Personality
Still confused and recovering from her magical imprisonment. Shows willingness to help and fight alongside her sister but defers to Clover's authority. Unfamiliar with non-druidic religious practices (confused by Tyr's statue). Resilient despite everything she's been through.

## Important Quotes
> "I don't know about the artifact. Everything went so fast. Suddenly, there were cultists everywhere. But I did hear, as they captured me, that they were looking for Thassa and they were looking for strong spellcasters that could bind someone." - Session 22, revealing crucial cult intelligence

> "This is not the Oak Father." - Session 22, confused by praying to Tyr

> "As soon as anything goes south, please let me know." - Session 22, to Clover about wanting to help

## History with Party
- **Pre-campaign**: Kidnapped from the Moonlit Pool when cultists attacked
- **Session 18**: Party discovered her floating in magical trance at House Castellers, connected to the sleeping children
- **Session 19**: Desna revealed she was under Tharizdun's direct spell, gave Dream Staff to free her
- **Session 20**: Party infiltrated House Castellers, preparing rescue mission
- **Session 21**: RESCUED. Dream-beast slain by party (Milo's Fireball dealt killing blow). Awoke confused but free. Evacuated via Vortex Warp.
- **Session 22**: Emotional reunion with Clover at Temple of Tyr. Morgane examined her and found no corruption. Learned their parents are dead (Clover saw them traveling to afterlife). Revealed cultists were seeking "Thassa" and spellcasters to "bind someone." Agreed to stay safe at temple while Clover finishes the mission.

## Rescue and Recovery
The party used the Dream Staff from Desna to enter her dreams. Inside, they found an elemental chimera-beast that adapted to damage types. When Milo killed the beast with a Fireball, its death scream transformed into Thistle's voice. The dream realm collapsed and she awoke.

At the Temple of Tyr, Morgane performed a thorough magical examination with glowing hands and confirmed: no physical damage, no magical corruption, nothing within her. Despite the ordeal, Thistle appears unharmed.

## Important Intelligence Provided
Thistle overheard the cultists during her capture:
- They were "looking for **Thassa**" (identity unknown - possibly an artifact, person, or entity)
- They wanted "strong spellcasters that could **bind someone**"
- This suggests the cultists had a specific binding ritual planned, possibly related to Tharizdun

## Family Situation
- Parents: **Dead** (Clover saw them on a boat traveling to the afterlife in a vision)
- Home: **Moonlit Pool** - destroyed by cultists
- Artifact: Something was stolen from the Moonlit Pool; Thistle doesn't know what
- Role: Clover is now Protector of the Moonlit Pool, with Thistle as secondary. Clover has promised to teach her "the ways"

## Current Situation
Safe at the Temple of Tyr in Waterdeep under Morgane's care. Has agreed to stay behind while Clover and the party handle the rescue of Lord Neverember and stop the cult. Still processing the loss of her parents and destruction of her home.
