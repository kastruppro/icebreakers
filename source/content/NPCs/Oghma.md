# Oghma

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Deity (Male presentation)
**Role:** God of Knowledge, Bards, Inspiration
**Status:** Active Deity
**Current Location:** Divine Realm (white throne room)

## Description
The Faerunian god of knowledge, inspiration, and bards. Patron deity of the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter. Appeared to Milo in a pure white throne room where everything - doors, surfaces, all - was white.

## Personality
Bound by celestial rules forbidding direct intervention, but willing to bend those rules for mortals with courage. Respects those bold enough to demand answers. Despite claiming inability to help directly, found a way to grant Milo power.

## Important Quotes
> "Find me when you come to Neverwinter. I have something for you because of everything you set in motion." - Session 8

> "Come to me, Milo." - Session 10, summoning Milo to his divine realm

> "I would like to help but am not allowed by the ancient rules for Celestials." - Session 10, explaining divine limitations before bending them

## History with Party
- Before Session 10: Previously told Milo "I have something for you" (referenced but exact session unknown)
- Session 10: When Milo confronted his statue in anger, Oghma answered. Transported Milo to a white throne room and appeared directly to him. Explained celestial rules forbid direct intervention but granted Milo the Fey Touched feat anyway. Confirmed the party's plan to travel to Waterdeep was correct.

## Secrets/Motivations
- Clearly interested in helping the party against Tharizdun
- Bound by "ancient rules for Celestials" - what exactly are these rules?
- May have additional gifts or guidance to offer if approached correctly
- His temple/library (House of Knowledge) may hold more relevant information

## Connections
- [[Milo Swiftclock]] - Granted Fey Touched, apparent chosen champion
- [[House of Knowledge]] - His temple/library in Neverwinter
- [[Master Tiberius Gearwhistle]] - High priest at his temple
- [[Elira Moonshadow]] - Serves at his temple
- [[Tharizdun]] - Opposed deity (knowledge vs chaos/madness)
