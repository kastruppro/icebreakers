# Percy

## Quick Reference
**Race/Gender:** Human Male
**Role:** Noble, Thief, Socialite
**Status:** Alive
**Current Location:** [[Waterdeep]]

## Description
Black long hair with a mustache. Often surrounded by admirers, particularly women. Exudes confidence and hedonistic charm. Orphaned - his parents died years ago, though he shows brief genuine sadness when mentioning this.

## Personality
Living life to the fullest with no apparent care for consequences. Hedonistic, seeking thrills and entertainment over responsibility. Nostalgic for his youth with Modred when they attended parties together. Bored with his easy life and seeking excitement through schemes like his proposed heist.

## Key Quotes
> "You used to be so fun, you know? You were at parties." - To Modred, Session 12
> "Just the usual - stealing and whoring." - About his current lifestyle
> "But that's no fun, isn't it?" - When asked why not just buy what he wants

## History with Party
- **Session 12**: Reunited with Modred at the Sated Satyr Inn. Proposed a heist on a rumored "necromancer" in the northern tower. Was playing cards surrounded by women. Modred declined to participate, and Jaspar openly disliked him.

## Current Situation
- Owns property and shop shares in Waterdeep
- Parents deceased (died years ago)
- Living off inheritance while pursuing pleasure
- Interested in robbing the rumored necromancer's tower for entertainment

## Connections
- [[Modred De Moray]] - Childhood friend, grew up together in noble circles
- [[House De Moray]] - Connected through Modred's family
- rumored necromancer - Heist target in northern tower

## The Heist Proposal
Target: A half-orc in the northern tower rumored to be a necromancer
- Actually may just be bullied and afraid, not actually a necromancer
- Never leaves the tower
- Supposedly has a staff that raises the dead
- Percy wants to do this for fun, not profit
