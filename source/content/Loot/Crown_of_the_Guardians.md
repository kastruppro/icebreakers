# Crown of the Guardians

*Wondrous item, legendary*

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** [[Modred De Moray]]
**Acquired:** Session 4 (Neverwinter Castle)
**Rarity:** Legendary

## Description

A crown containing the spirits of seven ghosts - the royal guard of [[Neverwinter]] who protected its rulers across generations. Each ghost died at different times while protecting kings from the cult.

## How It Was Found

In the dungeons of Neverwinter Castle, the party discovered a ghost chamber with ice formations and seven graves. One ghost was impaled by ice and in pain. When they helped it, seven ghosts manifested and spoke in unison.

The ghosts warned Jaspar about his cursed sword - the same power that killed them. They offered the crown to [[Modred De Moray]], who accepted it without hesitation. The ghosts performed a ritual around the crown before departing into it.

## Properties

**Ghostly Aid.** When worn, the spirits of the Seven Ghosts can provide aid to the wearer.

**Draining Effect.** Wearing the crown drains the wearer.

## The Seven Ghosts

The ghosts were Neverwinter's royal guard across generations, killed by the cult using the same power contained in Jaspar's sword.
