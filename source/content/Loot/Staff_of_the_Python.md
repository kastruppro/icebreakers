# Staff of the Python

*Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)*

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** TBD
**Acquired:** TBD
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Attunement:** Cleric, Druid, or Warlock

## Properties

**Weapon:** 1d6 bludgeoning (versatile 1d8)
**Weight:** 4 lbs
**Focus:** Can be used as an arcane or druidic focus

## Abilities

**Giant Constrictor Snake.** As an action, speak the command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control. The snake acts on its own initiative count.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

**Revert.** As a bonus action, speak the command word again to return the snake to staff form in its current space.

**Warning:** If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and the staff is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before dropping to 0 hit points, it regains all its hit points.
