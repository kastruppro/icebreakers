# Healing Hammer

*Weapon (warhammer), rare*

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** Lost (gem salvaged)
**Acquired:** Session 7
**Lost:** Session 8 (on the mountain)
**Status:** Destroyed/Abandoned

## Description

A magical hammer discovered on the frozen mountain where [[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora Swiftclock]] was found. The hammer had been stolen by Liora and [[Cora]] as part of their activities connected to the cult of [[Tharizdun]].

## The Ruby Gem

The hammer contained a corrupted ruby gem that was the source of the freezing magic affecting the mountain and Liora. When the party removed the gem from the hammer, the spell was broken and Liora was freed.

The gem likely contained the same enchantment as the ruby later placed in Milo's purchased mask - suggesting a connection to chronurgy or temporal magic.

## What Happened

- **Session 7:** Party discovered the hammer on the mountain
- **Session 8:** Removed the corrupted gem to free Liora; hammer left on mountain
- **Later:** The gem (now called Luxon fragment) was kept by Milo and incorporated into a mask

## Connections

- [[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora Swiftclock]] - Stole the hammer with Cora
- [[Cora]] - Helped steal the hammer
- [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]] - Kept the gem, uses it for time magic
