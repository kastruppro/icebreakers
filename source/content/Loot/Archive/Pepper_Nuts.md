## History
Isabella Adabrent sent these magical treats to Jaspar via a pink perfumed note, expressing her gratitude for a lovely evening at the masquerade ball.

When the party visited the Temple of Desna in Daggerford, Jaspar offered one of the pepper nuts to the goddess herself. Desna ate it and laughed as constellations formed a plant shape around her - even a goddess found amusement in these chaotic treats.

The nuts have already caused havoc elsewhere. Guards at House Adabrent were affected by them - one unfortunate guard was farting snow while his arms simultaneously turned to stone.

## Notes
- Excellent source of comic relief in tense situations
- Effects are completely random - use at your own risk
- A gift from Isabella Adabrent, suggesting a growing relationship with Jaspar
- Even goddesses are not immune to their effects (though Desna seemed to enjoy it)
- Consider the potential consequences before eating in serious situations
- Could be used tactically, though the unpredictability makes this risky
