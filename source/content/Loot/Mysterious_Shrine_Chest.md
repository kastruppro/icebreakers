# Mysterious Shrine Chest

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]]
**Acquired:** Session 21
**Rarity:** Unknown
**Status:** Contents Unknown (Unopened)

## Description
A small but heavy chest with an unusual weight-to-size ratio. The chest appears to be some form of shrine or reliquary, though its true purpose remains unknown.

## Location Found
Hidden room within [[House_Castellers|House Castellers]] study in Waterdeep. The room was concealed behind a painting and accessed via a pressure plate at floor level. The hidden chamber contained only this shrine/chest on a table, along with three glass containers on a nearby shelf (which [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia Castellers]] claimed were merely music-playing glasses, though they detected as slightly magical).

## Acquisition
During the chaotic escape from House Castellers in Session 21, after Victor was claimed by Tharizdun's chains, [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]] asked [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia Castellers]] about the painting in the study that he had noticed concealed something during an earlier party infiltration. Ammalia claimed ignorance, but Milo discovered the pressure plate mechanism and retrieved the chest from within.

## Properties
Unknown. The chest has not yet been opened or properly examined.

## Notes
- Found in a secret room that required finding a hidden pressure plate to access
- The room's hidden nature suggests the contents may be valuable or sensitive
- Three magical glass containers were left behind in the same room
- Ammalia's claim of ignorance about the hidden room may have been genuine or deceptive
- Should be examined carefully given the Castellers' connection to Tharizdun cultists
- Victor Castellers had made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun - this chest may be related

## Theories
- Could contain cult artifacts related to Tharizdun worship
- May hold evidence of the Castellers' dealings with dark forces
- Possibly contains something Victor was protecting or hiding from other cultists
- The shrine-like nature suggests it may have religious or magical significance
