# Hat of Vermin

*Wondrous item, common*

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** [[Clover]]
**Acquired:** TBD
**Rarity:** Common
**Attunement:** Not required

## Properties

This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and speak a command word that summons your choice of a bat, a frog, or a rat. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible.

The creature is neither combative nor friendly; it is an ordinary creature of its type. It vanishes after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 hit points.

**Charges:** The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
