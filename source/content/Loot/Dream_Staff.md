# Dream Staff

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** [[Clover]]
**Acquired:** Session 19
**Rarity:** Legendary

## Description
A glass staff that emanates warmth and light. The staff has an ethereal quality, seeming to shimmer with starlight and dream-like energy. It was crafted and blessed by the goddess Desna herself.

## Properties
- **Dream Walking:** Allows the user to enter the dreams or nightmares of others by pointing the staff at them
- **Sleep Aura:** Can put creatures to sleep (Wisdom save DC 16)
- **Weapon:** Can be used as a melee weapon

**CRITICAL WARNING:** If the user fails while inside someone's dream, they are trapped forever with the dreamer. There is no escape from this fate.

## History
The party visited the Temple of Desna in Daggerford seeking help for Thistle, Clover's sister who had been kidnapped and placed under a dark spell. When Desna appeared before them, she explained the grim truth: Thistle is under Tharizdun's direct spell, and no mortal magic can break it.

As the only hope to save Thistle, Desna bestowed this legendary staff upon Clover. It is the sole means by which he can enter his sister's nightmare and fight to free her from the Betrayer God's grasp.

## Notes
- Currently being used by Clover to fight corrupted Thistle in her nightmare
- The stakes could not be higher - failure means both Clover and Thistle are lost forever
- A divine gift from Desna, goddess of dreams, stars, and travelers
- The warmth and light it emanates may provide comfort or protection within the dream realm
