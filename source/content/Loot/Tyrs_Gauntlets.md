# Tyr's Gauntlets

## Quick Reference
**Holder:** [[Clover]]
**Acquired:** Session 16
**Rarity:** Legendary

## Description
Divine gauntlets originally from Tyr's own armory. They magically resize to fit the wearer - when Clover placed his hands through them, they shrank to perfectly fit his harengon form. The gauntlets carry the weight and authority of the god of justice himself.

## Properties
- **Chain Breaker:** Can interact with and destroy Tharizdun's chains at cult ruins
- **Divine Weapon:** A crucial weapon in the fight against the Betrayer God Tharizdun
- **Self-Adjusting:** Resizes to fit any wearer

### Party-Wide Boon
All party members received a special boon when the gauntlets were retrieved:

> *"As an action, you can sacrifice some or all of your hit points to give to another creature, but you take on all recent injuries and conditions from that creature, including diseases, dismemberment, and death. You instantly die if doing this would bring you to 0 hit points."*

## History
In Session 13, the party received a quest directly from Tyr to retrieve these gauntlets. They had been stolen from Tyr's armory and placed in cult temple ruins as part of Tharizdun's scheme - a deliberate insult to the god of justice.

The party ventured to the cult ruins and in Session 16, after solving chain puzzles and defeating oozes, they successfully retrieved the gauntlets. Clover claimed them, putting his hands through the divine artifacts which then shrank to fit his smaller harengon frame.

## Notes
- Essential for destroying Tharizdun's influence at cult sites
- The party-wide boon is incredibly powerful but comes with extreme risk
- Using the boon to save someone at death's door could result in the user's own death
- Represents a direct divine mandate from Tyr to oppose Tharizdun
