# House Castellers

## Overview
A wealthy noble house in [[Waterdeep]] that became entangled with the cult of [[Tharizdun]]. Their fortune grew suspiciously fast, and [[Victor Castellers]] made a deal with "the four princes" involving his own children.

## Members

|------|------|--------|
| [[Victor Castellers]] | Lord, patriarch | Claimed by Tharizdun |
| [[Ammalia Castellers]] | Lady, wife | Alive, widowed |

Behind a painting in the study (accessed via floor-level pressure plate):

When the party rescued the Castellers children in Session 21, Victor's deal with Tharizdun was broken. Red chains erupted from a circle beneath him and dragged him through a triangular portal - claimed as payment for the broken deal.
