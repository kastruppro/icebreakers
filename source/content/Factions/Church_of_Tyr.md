# Church of Tyr

## Overview
The organized worship of [[Tyr]], God of Justice. The church opposes [[Tharizdun]] and has tasked the party with destroying his chains using the sacred gauntlets.

## Key Members

| Name | Role | Location |
|------|------|----------|
| [[Tyr]] | God of Justice | Divine Realm |
| [[Morgane]] | Priestess | Temple of Tyr, Waterdeep |

## The Sacred Quest
Tyr appeared to Modred and Clover as a black hound in Session 13, tasking them with:
1. Retrieve [[Tyrs Gauntlets|Tyr's Gauntlets]] from the cult ruins *(Completed)*
2. Use the gauntlets to destroy Tharizdun's chains at four ruins around Waterdeep
3. Push Tharizdun further back into imprisonment

## Boon of Tyr
Granted to the entire party:
> "As an action, you can sacrifice some or all of your hit points to give to another creature, but you take on all recent injuries and conditions from that creature, including diseases, dismemberment, and death."

## Current Role
- [[House_of_Justice|Temple of Tyr]] provides sanctuary for Thistle, the Castellers children, and Ammalia
- Morgane serves as healer and divine connection
- Tyr continues to provide guidance through his black hound avatar

## Warnings from Tyr (Session 22)
> "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. Things are happening. Things are being put in process. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world."

> "I also feel something is happening within the walls of Waterdeep. Great power is coming from somewhere."
