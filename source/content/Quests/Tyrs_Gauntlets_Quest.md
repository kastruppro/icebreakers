# Tyr's Gauntlets Quest

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Active (URGENT - Tyr's Warning)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Quest Giver:** [[Tyr]] (God of Justice)
**Started:** Session 13
**Last Updated:** Session 22

## Objective
Use Tyr's Gauntlets to destroy Tharizdun's chains at four ruins around Waterdeep.

## Background
Tyr, the god of justice, appeared to the party with a divine mission. His sacred gauntlets had been stolen by the cult of Tharizdun and placed within one of their temple ruins. These gauntlets are the only weapons capable of destroying the chains that bind Tharizdun in his prison. Four ruins exist around Waterdeep, each containing a chain. Destroying all four will push Tharizdun further into imprisonment and weaken the cult's efforts to free him.

## Progress
- [x] Received quest from Tyr (Session 13)
- [x] Retrieved gauntlets from cult temple (Session 16)
- [x] Identified one ruin location (marsh south of Daggerford)
- [ ] Find 3 other ruin locations
- [ ] Destroy chain at marsh ruin south of Daggerford
- [ ] Destroy chain at second ruin
- [ ] Destroy chain at third ruin
- [ ] Destroy chain at fourth ruin

## Key Information
- Tyr's Gauntlets are now sized for Clover
- The gauntlets are the only weapons that can destroy Tharizdun's chains
- Four ruins total must be cleansed
- One known location: marsh south of Daggerford
- Three ruin locations still unknown

### Boon of Tyr
The party has been granted Tyr's Boon:
- Party members can sacrifice their own HP to heal others
- When healing this way, they can also take on the target's conditions

## Rewards
- Tharizdun pushed further into imprisonment
- Weakening of the cult's power
- Divine favor of Tyr
- Potential prevention of apocalypse

## NPCs Involved
- [[Tyr]] - God of Justice, quest giver
- [[Clover]] - Current bearer of the gauntlets
- Tharizdun cultists - Opposition at each ruin

## Locations
- Cult Temple - Where gauntlets were retrieved (Session 16)
- Marsh south of Daggerford - First known ruin location
- Three unknown ruin locations around Waterdeep

## Session 22 - Tyr's Urgent Warning

Tyr appeared to Modred via a black dog at the Temple of Tyr. The dog led Modred to Tyr's divine workshop where the god delivered a critical warning:

> "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. Things are happening. Things are being put in process. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world."

Tyr specifically reminded Modred about the temple ruins south of Daggerford:

> "As I've requested before, I want you and your friends to go to the ruins of Tharizdun's temple. Find the chains, use the weapon I gave you to throw Tharizdun back into the light."

### Additional Divine Intel
- Tyr confirmed "great power" is emanating from somewhere within Waterdeep
- The situation is escalating - Tharizdun is "moving fast in the shadows"
- When Modred asked what to prioritize (ruins vs. Waterdeep), Tyr gave freedom: "Go wherever you feel is best to go. Something might happen here in Waterdeep as well."

### Current Party Decision
The party chose to deal with the Lord Neverember rescue first (Session 22-23), then travel to the temple ruins south of Daggerford. This mission cannot be delayed much longer.

## Notes
- This is a divine quest with world-altering stakes
- The gauntlets being sized for Clover suggests she is meant to wield them (Note: Session 22 says Modred has the gauntlets)
- The Boon of Tyr adds tactical options for party healing
- Destroying all chains is critical to stopping Tharizdun's return
- Expect heavy cult resistance at each ruin
- May need to investigate or gather information to locate the remaining three ruins
- **Session 22:** Tyr explicitly warned that time is running out - this quest is now CRITICAL priority
- The party must address the Daggerford ruins immediately after the Neverember rescue
