# Stop Tharizdun's Release

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Active (CRITICAL - Time Running Out)
**Priority:** WORLD-ENDING THREAT
**Quest Giver:** [[Tyr]] (God of Justice)
**First Mentioned:** Session 13
**Last Updated:** Session 22

## Objective
Prevent the cult of Tharizdun from freeing the Chained God and destroying the world.

## Background
Tharizdun, known as the Chained God, the Betrayer God, and the god of destruction, is imprisoned by divine chains. A cult has been working to free him, which would result in the destruction of the entire world. The god Tyr has tasked the The Icebreakers with stopping this apocalyptic threat.

## The Threat

Tharizdun is:
- The "Betrayer God" - imprisoned for attempting to destroy all existence
- Bound by divine chains at multiple locations
- Actively being freed by cultists across the Sword Coast
- Connected to corruption that spreads through his servants (blackened hands/fingers)

## Session 22 - Tyr's Warning

Tyr appeared to Modred at the Temple of Tyr with an urgent warning:

> "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. Things are happening. Things are being put in process. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world."

### Key Intel from Tyr
- Tharizdun is "moving fast in the shadows"
- "Great power" is emanating from somewhere within Waterdeep (source unknown)
- The temple ruins south of Daggerford must be addressed urgently
- The party has been given freedom to choose priorities, but time is running out

## Progress
- [x] Learned of Tharizdun cult's existence
- [x] Received divine quest from Tyr to destroy chains (Session 13)
- [x] Retrieved Gauntlets of Tyr from cult temple (Session 16)
- [x] Infiltrated House Castellers - discovered deep cult involvement (Session 17)
- [x] Rescued Thistle from Tharizdun's direct spell (Session 21)
- [x] Discovered Lord Neverember in active Tharizdun ritual (Session 21)
- [x] Victor Castellers claimed by Tharizdun - removed as cult agent (Session 21)
- [x] Received urgent warning from Tyr about accelerating timeline (Session 22)
- [ ] Rescue Lord Neverember from basement ritual
- [ ] Destroy chains at temple ruins south of Daggerford
- [ ] Find and destroy chains at 3 other ruin locations
- [ ] Identify "the four princes" of Tharizdun
- [ ] Locate source of "great power" in Waterdeep
- [ ] Stop the cult's ultimate plan

## Known Cult Operations

### House Castellers (Waterdeep)
- Victor Castellers made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun
- Sebastian (corrupted - fully black hands) is involved
- Basement contains active ritual with Lord Neverember
- Two druids with flowers in hair participating in rituals
- 8-10 cultists performing ceremonies
- Victor has been claimed by Tharizdun - status of cult leadership unknown

### Temple Ruins South of Daggerford
- Contains Tharizdun's chains
- The Gauntlets of Tyr can destroy these chains
- Tyr has urgently requested this location be addressed
- Expected heavy cult resistance

### Other Locations
- Three other ruin locations around Waterdeep (unknown)
- "Great power" source somewhere in Waterdeep (unknown)

## The Corruption

Tharizdun's influence manifests as physical corruption:
- **Sebastian:** Fully black hands (advanced corruption)
- **Modred:** Blackened fingers (early corruption from Gauntlets)
- The corruption appears to spread through service to or contact with Tharizdun's power

## Key Questions
- What is "Thassa" that the cultists were seeking?
- What binding ritual requires "strong spellcasters"?
- Who are "the four princes" of Tharizdun?
- What is the source of "great power" Tyr sensed in Waterdeep?
- What is the cult's ultimate endgame?

## Related Quests
- [[Tyrs_Gauntlets_Quest]] - Destroy chains at four ruins
- [[Find_Lord_Neverember]] - Rescue from cult ritual (now renamed Rescue Lord Neverember)
- [[Investigate_House_Castellers]] - Expose cult operations in Waterdeep

## NPCs Involved
- [[Tyr]] - God of Justice, guiding the party against Tharizdun
- [[Tharizdun]] - The Chained God, the ultimate threat
- [[Sebastian]] - Corrupted cult member
- [[Victor_Castellers|Victor Castellers]] - Claimed by Tharizdun
- "The Four Princes" - Unknown entities connected to Tharizdun
- Unknown Druids (2) - Participating in rituals
- Cloaked Cultists - Foot soldiers of the cult

## Urgency Assessment

**CRITICAL** - Tyr has explicitly warned that Tharizdun is "moving fast in the shadows" and the party must "act swiftly" or face world destruction. This is not a slow-burn threat - the timeline is actively accelerating.

### Immediate Priorities (Session 23+)
1. Rescue Lord Neverember from basement ritual
2. Travel to temple ruins south of Daggerford
3. Destroy the chains using Gauntlets of Tyr
4. Investigate source of power in Waterdeep

## Notes
- This is the overarching campaign threat
- All other quests (Thistle rescue, Neverember rescue, House Castellers investigation) are connected to this main storyline
- The party has divine backing from Tyr but faces a god-level threat
- Time is explicitly stated to be running out
- Session 22 marked a turning point where urgency escalated significantly
