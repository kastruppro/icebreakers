## Session 21 Major Developments

### Victor Claimed by Tharizdun
When Milo teleported the Castellers children to safety outside the compound, Victor's deal with Tharizdun was broken. A red circle appeared beneath him, chains erupted from the ground, and he was dragged screaming through a triangular portal. Ammalia tried to touch the chains but was burned. Victor is gone, claimed by Tharizdun.

### The Four Princes Revealed
Ammalia revealed that Victor had made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun. The nature of these entities and their connection to the cult remains unknown.

### Basement Ritual Chamber Discovered
Milo's owl familiar explored three basement passages:
1. **Left passage**: Dead end tomb room with stone coffins of earlier Castellers, one figure holding a mace
2. **Middle passage**: Bedroom with beds and furniture - someone lives down here
3. **Right passage**: Massive ritual chamber containing:
   - Giant statue of Tharizdun in chains
   - Lord Neverember chained in a summoning circle (center of room)
   - 8-10 cloaked cultists chanting "Tharizdun"
   - Two individuals in earthy clothes with flowers in hair (druids?) casting spells
   - Pool of water before the statue

### Hidden Room Found
Milo discovered a pressure plate at floor level in the study that opened a painting like a door. Inside was a small room containing:
- A shrine/chest on a table (taken by Milo, contents unknown)
- Three glass containers on a shelf (slightly magical, Ammalia claimed they play music)

## Key Information
- Sebastian's hands are completely black - a sign of advanced Tharizdun corruption
- Victor made a deal with "the four princes" of Tharizdun involving children
- Victor has been claimed by Tharizdun - status unknown
- The Book of Vile Darkness was in their possession (now stolen by party)
- A full cult ritual is actively being performed on Lord Neverember in the basement
- Two druids with flowers in hair are participating in the evil ritual
- Ammalia Castellers appears separate from the conspiracy and has allied with the party
- Ammalia is now alone - her children rescued, her husband claimed by Tharizdun

### Corruption Signs
- Sebastian: Fully black hands (advanced corruption)
- Compare to Modred: Blackened fingers (early corruption)

## Rewards (Potential/Obtained)
- [x] Disruption of cult operations in Waterdeep
- [x] Book of Vile Darkness secured
- [x] Castellers children rescued
- [x] Victor removed as cult agent
- [x] Mysterious shrine/chest recovered
- [ ] Rescue Lord Neverember
- [ ] Expose remaining noble corruption

## Session 22 Developments

### Public Backlash
As the party escorted Ammalia through Waterdeep to the Temple of Tyr, they encountered hostile citizens. Someone shouted "Child killer!" and threw a bottle at the temple wall. The rumors about House Castellers' supposed involvement in child deaths are spreading through the city.

### Ammalia's Cooperation
Ammalia provided additional intelligence during the strategy meeting:
- Confirmed Sebastian's hand was black when he visited the masquerade
- Victor had invited Sebastian despite him being 15 days' sailing away in Neverwinter
- Sebastian appeared at the party and spoke privately with Victor
- Victor always wore gloves, so his corruption level is unknown
- The children's enchanted sleep started suddenly
- Victor told her it was "for the greater good" and to "make House Castellers more powerful"
- Ammalia believes the house guards will still answer to her as mistress of the house

### Assault Planning
The party has completed planning for a 4am assault on the Castellers basement:
- Daggers of the North watching the mansion overnight
- Ammalia may command house guards for access
- Party is rested and at full strength (Level 6)

## Next Steps
1. Execute 4am assault on basement ritual chamber
2. Rescue Lord Neverember
3. Neutralize remaining cultists
4. Examine the mysterious shrine/chest (Milo has it)
5. Identify the two druids with flowers in hair
6. Learn more about "the four princes" of Tharizdun
7. Determine Sebastian's current status and location

## Notes
- The conspiracy is far deeper than initially suspected
- An active ritual is being performed on Lord Neverember RIGHT NOW
- Victor's removal may destabilize the cult's operations but the ritual continues
- The connection to Thistle's captivity has been resolved
- Ammalia is cooperating fully and may provide house guard access
- The house's rapid rise to power was fueled by demonic pacts with "the four princes"
- This investigation is now critical to saving Lord Neverember and stopping Tharizdun's plans
- Tyr warned that "great power" is emanating from somewhere in Waterdeep - may be connected to Castellers
