# Rescue Thistle

## Quick Reference
**Status:** COMPLETED (Confirmed Safe)
**Priority:** Low (Resolved)
**Quest Giver:** [[Clover]] (Personal Quest)
**Started:** Session 14
**Completed:** Session 21
**Last Updated:** Session 22

## Objective
Free Clover's sister Thistle from Tharizdun's direct spell.

## Background
Thistle was found floating in House Castellers' children's room, channeling magic to the sleeping children below. She was under the direct spell of Tharizdun, the chained god of destruction. No mortal magic could break his hold - the goddess Desna revealed that the Dream Staff was the only solution. The party entered Thistle's nightmare and freed her from within.

## Progress
- [x] Found Thistle at House Castellers
- [x] Learned from Desna that no mortal magic works on Tharizdun's spell
- [x] Received Dream Staff from Desna
- [x] Allied with Ammalia Castellers
- [x] Entered Thistle's dream
- [x] Defeated the Elemental Chimera-Beast (Session 21)
- [x] Thistle freed when dream-beast was slain

## Session 21 Resolution
The party fought an elemental chimera-beast in the dream realm - a creature that adapted to whatever damage type was used against it. The room itself transformed to match the beast's element, dealing passive fire damage to everyone nearby.

**Key moments:**
- Clover opened with a critical hit in wolf form
- Jaspar's investigation (rolled 24) revealed the beast's adaptive nature
- Clover's clutch **Elemental Weapon (Cold)** spell on Modred's sword turned the tide
- Modred's gauntlets allowed him to overcome damage resistances
- Milo delivered the killing blow with **Fireball** (32 damage, halved to 16)
- As the beast died, its scream transformed into Thistle's voice
- The dream realm collapsed and the party woke in the Castellers' bedroom with Thistle freed

## Key Information
- Thistle is Clover's sister, a fellow harengon
- She was kidnapped and placed under Tharizdun's control
- The children in House Castellers were receiving magic channeled through her
- The Dream Staff allowed entry into her nightmare realm
- Inside the dream, Thistle manifested as a corrupted Elemental Chimera-Beast
- The beast adapted to damage types, requiring tactical creativity to defeat

## Rewards
- Thistle freed and reunited with Clover
- Disruption of cult's plans at House Castellers
- Discovered Lord Neverember's location in basement ritual
- Rescued the Castellers children

## NPCs Involved
- [[Clover]] - Quest giver, Thistle's sister
- [[Thistle]] - Now rescued and with the party
- [[Desna]] - Goddess who provided the Dream Staff and guidance
- [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia Castellers]] - Allied with party to help
- [[Tharizdun]] - The chained god who held Thistle captive
- [[Merin]] - Tabaxi rogue from Daggers of the North who assisted escape

## Locations
- [[House_Castellers|House Castellers]] - Where Thistle was found
- Thistle's Dream Realm - Where the final battle took place

## Session 22 - Confirmed Safe

Thistle was brought to the Temple of Tyr and examined by [[Morgane]] (Modred's mother, a priestess). Morgane's magical examination confirmed:
- **No physical damage**
- **No magical damage**
- **No corruption or demonic influence**
- Thistle is completely unharmed from her captivity

### Emotional Reunion
Clover and Thistle had an emotional conversation at the temple:
- Clover revealed their parents are dead (she saw them traveling to the afterlife in a vision)
- Clover informed Thistle about the destruction of their home at the Moonlit Pool
- Thistle agreed to stay at the temple while Clover retrieves the stolen artifact and gets justice

### Key Information from Thistle
Thistle revealed what she overheard during her capture:
> "I don't know about the artifact. Everything went so fast. Suddenly, there were cultists everywhere. But I did hear, as they captured me, that they were looking for Thassa and they were looking for strong spellcasters that could bind someone."

This suggests the cultists have a specific binding ritual planned involving someone named "Thassa."

### Clover's Promise
Clover made a solemn vow to her sister:
> "With our parents gone, the role falls to us. I will teach you the ways. I promise."

As Protector of the Moonlit Pool, Clover now bears that responsibility, with Thistle as secondary.

### Current Status
- **Location:** Temple of Tyr, Waterdeep
- **Condition:** Safe and healthy
- **Guardian:** Under the protection of Morgane and the Temple priests
- **Emotional state:** Processing grief over parents, confusion about recent events

## Notes
- Quest completed successfully in Session 21
- Session 22 confirmed Thistle is safe and free of corruption
- This was deeply personal to Clover - she refused to leave without her sister
- The rescue triggered Victor's deal with Tharizdun to break, causing him to be claimed
- Connected to the larger Tharizdun cult conspiracy
- Thistle is now safe at the Temple of Tyr under Morgane's protection
- New lead: Cultists were "looking for Thassa" and seeking "strong spellcasters that could bind someone"
