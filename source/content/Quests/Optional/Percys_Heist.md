# Percy's Heist

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Available (Not Started)
**Priority:** Optional Side Quest
**Quest Giver:** [[Percy]]
**Offered:** Session 12

## Objective
Help Percy rob the "necromancer" in the northern tower of Waterdeep.

## Background
[[Percy]], [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]]'s childhood friend from Waterdeep's noble circles, proposed a heist for entertainment. Despite being wealthy enough to buy whatever he wants, Percy seeks thrills and excitement through schemes like this.

## The Target
- **Location:** Northern tower in Waterdeep
- **Occupant:** A half-orc rumored to be a necromancer
- **Reality:** May actually just be a bullied, fearful person - not necessarily a necromancer
- **Behavior:** Never leaves the tower
- **Prize:** A staff that supposedly raises the dead

## Progress
- [x] Percy proposed the heist (Session 12)
- [ ] Accept or decline the job
- [ ] Scout the northern tower
- [ ] Execute the heist
- [ ] Obtain the necromancer's staff

## Party's Response
- [[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] declined to participate
- [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] openly disliked Percy
- Quest remains available if the party changes their mind

## Key Quotes
> "You used to be so fun, you know? You were at parties." - Percy to Modred
> "Just the usual - stealing and whoring." - Percy about his lifestyle
> "But that's no fun, isn't it?" - Percy when asked why not just buy things

## Rewards (Potential)
- The necromancer's staff (raises the dead?)
- Percy's friendship and gratitude
- Whatever else is in the tower
- Entertainment value

## Considerations
- Is the half-orc actually a necromancer or just misunderstood?
- What are the ethical implications of robbing someone who may be innocent?
- Percy's motivations are purely for fun, not necessity

## NPCs Involved
- [[Percy]] - Quest giver, childhood friend of Modred
- Half-orc "Necromancer" - Target (may be misunderstood)

## Locations
- [[Waterdeep]] - Northern tower

## Notes
- This is a completely optional side quest
- The party declined initially but could return to it later
- Percy remains in Waterdeep and the offer likely stands
