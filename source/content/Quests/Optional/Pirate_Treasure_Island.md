# Pirate Treasure Island

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Available (Not Pursued)
**Priority:** Optional Side Quest
**Quest Giver:** Self-discovered
**Found:** Session 6

## Objective
Explore the unmarked island on the pirate captain's treasure map.

## Background
While raiding the [[Frozen_Pirate_Ship|Frozen Pirate Ship]] in Session 6, the party discovered a treasure map in the captain's cabin. The frozen captain was found pointing at the map, which showed several islands marked with X's - and one mysterious unmarked island.

## The Treasure Map
- Found in the captain's cabin of the frozen pirate ship
- Shows multiple islands marked with X's (likely already looted)
- Contains ONE unmarked island - potentially undiscovered treasure
- [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] marked the unmarked island with an "O"
- Currently in Milo's possession

## Progress
- [x] Found treasure map on frozen pirate ship (Session 6)
- [x] Milo marked the unmarked island (Session 6)
- [ ] Research the island's location
- [ ] Acquire transportation (ship?)
- [ ] Travel to the unmarked island
- [ ] Explore and discover what's there

## Unanswered Questions
- What is on the unmarked island?
- Why was it unmarked when other islands had X's?
- What was the frozen captain trying to tell them by pointing at the map?
- Is the treasure still there, or is something else waiting?

## Rewards (Potential)
- Pirate treasure (gold, gems, magic items?)
- Discovery of a hidden location
- Answers about the frozen captain's fate
- Adventure and exploration

## Challenges
- Need sea transportation
- Location may be dangerous
- Unknown what awaits on the island

## Notes
