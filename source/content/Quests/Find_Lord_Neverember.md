## Session 21 Discovery

Milo's owl familiar explored the Castellers basement and discovered three passages:

1. **Left passage**: Dead end tomb room with stone coffins of earlier Castellers nobles
2. **Middle passage**: Bedroom/living quarters - someone lives down here
3. **Right passage**: Massive ritual chamber

### The Ritual Chamber
The owl observed a horrifying scene:
- **Giant statue of Tharizdun in chains** dominating the room
- **Lord Neverember chained in a summoning circle** at the center
- **8-10 cloaked cultists** standing in a circle, chanting "Tharizdun"
- **Two individuals in earthy clothes with flowers in hair** (likely druids) casting spells
- **Pool of water** positioned before the statue

The ritual is ACTIVELY IN PROGRESS. Lord Neverember's condition is unknown, but he is alive and imprisoned.

## Key Information
- Lord Neverember is the Open Lord of Waterdeep - his rescue has major political implications
- He is chained in an active summoning/ritual circle
- At least 10-12 cultists are present (8-10 in robes + 2 druids)
- The ritual's purpose is unknown but likely connected to freeing Tharizdun
- The basement has multiple passages - tactical options exist
- Victor Castellers has been claimed by Tharizdun - the cultists may not know yet
- The party currently has Ammalia Castellers as an ally who may know basement layout

## Challenges
- Significant number of enemies (10-12+)
- Unknown magical protections on the ritual circle
- Two spellcasters (the druids) actively casting
- Limited information about enemy capabilities
- Party is depleted from the dream-beast combat
- Sebastian's whereabouts unknown - could be in basement

## Potential Allies
- [[Daggers of the North]] - May provide backup for rescue operation
- [[Ammalia Castellers]] - Knows the estate, may provide information
- [[Marin]] - Tabaxi rogue currently with party

## NPCs Involved
- [[Lord Neverember]] - The prisoner to be rescued
- [[Daggers of the North]] - Quest givers
- Unknown Druids (2) - Casting spells in the ritual
- Cloaked Cultists (8-10) - Chanting around Lord Neverember
- [[Sebastian]] - May be involved, location unknown
- [[Ammalia Castellers]] - Potential source of information

## Locations
- [[House Castellers]] - Location of the ritual
- House Castellers Basement - Ritual Chamber - Where Neverember is imprisoned
- Waterdeep - City location

## Rewards (Potential)
- Lord Neverember's gratitude and political favor
- Disruption of Tharizdun's plans
- Daggers of the North alliance strengthened
- Possible insight into the cult's ultimate goals
- Stopping whatever the ritual is attempting to accomplish

## Session 22 Planning Phase

The party regrouped at the Temple of Tyr and held a strategy meeting with key allies.

### Information Shared
- Milo revealed his reconnaissance: Lord Neverember chained in summoning circle with 8-10 cultists performing Tharizdun ritual
- Party confirmed basement layout: chapel/mausoleum, living quarters, and ritual chamber
- Witnessed Victor being dragged through triangular portal by chains when his deal broke

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Rest first** - Party was depleted (Milo had only 2 spell slots, Clover limited). Decided to long rest despite risk.
2. **4am assault** - Surgical operation at dawn when defenses may be lower
3. **Daggers of the North** - Assigned overnight surveillance to ensure no one leaves the mansion
4. **Ammalia's authority** - As mistress of House Castellers, she can potentially command house guards and provide legitimate access

### Party Status After Rest
- All party members at full HP and spell slots
- Party leveled up to Level 6 during long rest
- Clover gained new wild shapes (Giant Constrictor Snake)
- Milo gained access to 3rd level spells
- Jaspar multiclassed into Artificer

### Raenar's Involvement
Raenar Neverember learned his father is imprisoned. He is distressed but agreed to the planned approach rather than rushing in. He expressed concern about large guard forces alerting cultists to kill his father.

## Next Steps
1. Execute assault at 4am
2. Use Ammalia to potentially command house guards
3. Navigate basement to ritual chamber
4. Defeat 8-10 cultists and 2 druids
5. Free Lord Neverember from summoning circle
6. Escape with Neverember to safety

## Urgency Assessment
The ritual is ACTIVELY IN PROGRESS. The party is now rested, leveled, and has a coordinated plan. The Daggers are watching to ensure no one escapes. The assault must happen before the ritual completes.

**Status:** Ready to execute rescue operation.

## Notes
- Thistle's rescue completed - this is now the highest priority quest
- Lord Neverember's importance to Waterdeep cannot be overstated
- The ritual's purpose may be connected to freeing Tharizdun
- Victor's removal may cause confusion among the cultists - opportunity window
- The two druids with flowers in their hair are unusual - nature-worshippers serving Tharizdun?
- Connected to Investigate House Castellers quest
- Success here could be a major blow to the Tharizdun cult in Waterdeep
- Tyr warned Modred that "things are moving fast" - rescue is time-critical
