# Modred: Reconcile with Father

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Active
**Priority:** Personal Quest
**Character:** [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]]
**Started:** Session 12
**Last Updated:** Session 22

## Objective
Decide whether to reconcile with or confront [[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin]], Modred's estranged and mentally broken father.

## Background
[[Modred_De_Moray|Modred]] left [[House_De_Moray|House De Moray]] years ago to become a knight, distancing himself from his father's increasingly erratic behavior. After [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur]]'s possession and disappearance, [[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin]] descended into alcoholism and madness. [[Morgane]], Modred's mother, left to become a priestess of [[Tyr]].

## Timeline

### Session 2 - Vision
Modred had a vision of his father in [[Waterdeep]] telling him he was a disappointment.

### Session 9 - Corruption Confirmed
[[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora]] mentioned that Godwin ("Godwen") is corrupted - confirming fears about his father's connection to dark forces.

### Session 12 - Confrontation at House De Moray
The party visited [[House_De_Moray_Estate|House De Moray]] seeking to reconnect:
- Found Godwin in the dark throne room, surrounded by empty bottles
- Godwin rejected Modred: *"I have no son. My son is gone. Leave."*
- Godwin attacked the party with **Wall of Fire** (20 damage)
- [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] used Chronal Shift and Dispel Magic to stop the attack
- Godwin collapsed sobbing
- [[Ulrik]] explained the family's tragedy

### Session 15 - Guard's Reminder
A city guard reminded Modred about his father's failed expedition with [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur]] to the [[Temple_of_Tharizdun|Tharizdun ruins]] - the mission where Arthur became corrupted.

### Session 19 - Dream Reading
[[Desna]] revealed what Godwin dreams of:
> "Godwin dreams of guilt, hatred, and shame."

Modred expressed desire to visit his father again after learning this.

### Session 22 - Unexpected Development
[[Morgane]] revealed shocking news:
- Godwin visited the [[House_of_Justice|Temple of Tyr]] **while sober**
- He specifically asked to see Modred
- He "didn't look good" but was clearly making an effort
- This is unprecedented behavior for the broken lord

## Key Quotes

> "I have no son. My son is gone. Leave." - Godwin to Modred (Session 12)

> "Last time I went to see him, he tried to kill me." - Modred, about his father (Session 22)

> "Godwin dreams of guilt, hatred, and shame." - Desna (Session 19)

## Progress
- [x] Received vision of father (Session 2)
- [x] Learned father is corrupted (Session 9)
- [x] Confronted father at House De Moray (Session 12)
- [x] Learned father's dreams are full of guilt (Session 19)
- [x] Learned father visited temple sober, asking for Modred (Session 22)
- [ ] Decide whether to meet Godwin
- [ ] Confront or reconcile with father

## The Dilemma
Modred must decide:
- **Meet Godwin:** Risk another violent confrontation, but Godwin's sober visit suggests possible change
- **Refuse:** Protect himself from more pain, but miss potential reconciliation
- **Confront:** Demand answers about Arthur's corruption and Godwin's role in it

## Complicating Factors
- Godwin attacked the party with lethal magic
- Godwin and Arthur investigated cultists together before Arthur was possessed
- Godwin is confirmed to be corrupted (per Liora)
- Godwin's dreams are full of guilt - he may know more than he's revealed
- The Tharizdun cult connection to the family runs deep

## NPCs Involved
- [[Godwin_De_Moray|Godwin De Moray]] - Father, Lord of House De Moray (mad)
- [[Morgane]] - Mother, Priestess of Tyr (intermediary)
- [[Arthur_De_Moray|Arthur De Moray]] - Brother (former possession victim)
- [[Ulrik]] - House guard, loyal to the family

## Locations
- [[House_De_Moray_Estate|House De Moray Estate]] - Family home in Waterdeep
- [[House_of_Justice|Temple of Tyr]] - Where Godwin asked for Modred

## Notes
- This quest is deeply personal and emotional
- Morgane left the decision to Modred
- Current rescue mission for Lord Neverember takes priority
- May intersect with the larger Tharizdun plotline given family connections
