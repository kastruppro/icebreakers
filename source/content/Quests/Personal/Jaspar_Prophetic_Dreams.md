# Jaspar: Prophetic Dreams

## Quick Reference
**Status:** Active (Ongoing Mystery)
**Priority:** Personal Quest
**Character:** [[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar Starshade]]
**Started:** Session 4
**Last Updated:** Session 19

## Objective
Understand why Jaspar possesses prophetic dreams that even the gods cannot control or affect.

## Background
[[Jaspar_Starshade|Jaspar]] is an Aasimar with mysterious origins. Throughout the campaign, he has experienced vivid prophetic dreams that appear to show future events. Most remarkably, the goddess [[Desna]] herself - Lady of Dreams - revealed she cannot affect or control his dreams.

## The Dreams

### Session 4 - First Nightmare
Jaspar had a prophetic dream:
- Falling sensation
- Burning everywhere
- Seeing burning fields

### Session 5 - Divine Vision
A more elaborate prophetic dream:
- Fire and divine intervention
- Wings of divine beings
- An ominous voice declaring: *"Jaspar my child, soon we will conquer the world."*
- Selûne appeared in the dream

## Desna's Revelation (Session 19)

When [[Desna]] read the dreams of various individuals, she made a stunning revelation about Jaspar:

> "Jaspar's dreams can come to pass - prophetic. Even I cannot affect them."

She explained further:
- His dreams exist in a **crossover between dreams and something else**
- They are immune to divine interference
- Not even the goddess of dreams can control them

## Possible Connections

### The "Father" Entity
In [[The_Void|the Void]], Jaspar met an entity claiming to be his creator/father:
- Claimed Jaspar is an Aasimar "made in his image"
- Created specifically to "save the world"
- Granted him mysterious warm orange-red energy
- Warned him: *"Don't trust Cora - she'll use shadow to destroy everything."*

Could the prophetic dreams be connected to this entity?

### Tharizdun Connection?
- Jaspar's rapier reacts to substances connected to the Tharizdun cult
- The "Father" entity appeared near a floating cyst (possibly Tharizdun's "shell")
- [[Tharizdun]] is known for manipulation and deception
- Some speculate Jaspar's prophetic dreams may show Tharizdun's influence

### Celestial Heritage
- As an Aasimar, Jaspar has celestial blood
- His prophetic ability may stem from this divine heritage
- But why would even Desna be unable to affect celestial dreams?

## Progress
- [x] First prophetic nightmare (Session 4)
- [x] Vision with divine voice claiming "we will conquer the world" (Session 5)
- [x] Met "Father" entity in the Void (Sessions 7, 11)
- [x] Received warning about Cora (Session 11)
- [x] Desna confirmed dreams are beyond divine control (Session 19)
- [ ] Understand the source of the prophetic ability
- [ ] Learn why gods cannot affect his dreams
- [ ] Discover connection between dreams and "Father" entity
- [ ] Determine if dreams show destiny or warning

## Key Questions
1. Who/what is the "Father" entity that claims to have created Jaspar?
2. Why are his dreams immune to divine influence?
3. What does "we will conquer the world" mean?
4. Is this power a gift, a curse, or a trap?
5. Are his prophetic visions inevitable or warnings of what to prevent?

## Themes
- **Fate vs. Free Will:** Do prophetic dreams predetermine destiny?
- **Divine Mystery:** Why would celestial beings be unable to affect him?
- **Trust:** The "Father's" warning about Cora - is it truth or manipulation?
- **Identity:** What does it mean to be "made in his image"?

## NPCs Involved
- [[Desna]] - Goddess of Dreams, cannot affect Jaspar's visions
- "Father" Entity - Mysterious being claiming to be Jaspar's creator
- Selûne - Appeared in prophetic dream
- [[Cora]] - Subject of the Father's warning

## Locations
- [[The_Void|The Void]] - Where Jaspar met the "Father" entity
- [[Dream_Realm|Dream Realm]] - Where normal dreams occur (but Jaspar's exist elsewhere)

## Notes
- This is one of the campaign's central mysteries
- The truth about Jaspar's nature may have major plot implications
- The "Father" entity's true identity remains unconfirmed
- Jaspar asked for time to think rather than immediately accepting or rejecting the entity's claims
