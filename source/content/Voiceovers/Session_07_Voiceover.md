# Session 7 Voiceover: "Through the Void"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session Seven: *"Through the Void."*

**[beat]** The ancient halls of Axeholm stretched before them, dark and cold as a tomb. Dwarven architecture, once proud, now shrouded in ice and shadow. The party moved cautiously—Milo, Jaspar, and Auren—with Modred's absence weighing heavily on their already diminished numbers. The corridor ahead was blocked by ice. Two passages led backward into darkness. And somewhere deeper within, they heard it: something small skittering, then a thunderous roar.
**[pause]** A voice cried out for help.

**[warmer tone]** They found him in an upper chamber—Braum, the last unfrozen dwarf of Axeholm, locked in desperate combat with a stone giant. Milo didn't hesitate; his spell flew true, but it triggered something worse. Four frost skeletons erupted from the ice, splitting their attention between the giant and the undead horrors. The stone giant's cone of frost caught Milo and Auren in its path—and for one terrible moment, Milo saw his own death.
**[beat]** Chronal Shift. Time bent around the harengon wizard as he pulled himself from the jaws of fate. Jaspar's arrow found the giant's throat, and silence fell at last.

**[darker shift]** But peace was short-lived. Braum's gratitude curdled to fury the moment he saw Milo's ears. "How dare you show up after stealing from me!" The dwarf's accusations hung heavy in the frozen air—a harengon had stolen his family's heirloom, a hammer of healing magic, just nights before.
**[softer]** Milo knew. He knew in his bones who the thief had been. But when he spoke, he chose his words carefully: "There are others like me." He would not name his sister. Not yet.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** That night, as the others slept, Auren slipped into meditation—and found himself somewhere else entirely. The Feywild stretched before him, familiar and achingly beautiful beneath a full moon. His friend Thistle appeared with a warning that chilled deeper than any ice: "If a man is released, the forest will burn."
**[voice breaking slightly]** An omen from home. A threat he couldn't yet understand.

**[adventure building]** Morning brought discovery. Snow seeped through a wall bearing a triangular symbol—the same mark they'd seen when Lord Neverember fell. Milo recognized it instantly. With Luxon fragment in hand and the strange scimitar they'd found, he began the ritual.
**[building intensity]** The substance moved. It crawled from the fragment to the scimitar, then reached for Milo's hand. He dropped it in revulsion. But a voice whispered in Jaspar's mind: *Take it*. The rogue carved the triangle into the wall, and darkness bloomed—a portal into the void itself. Auren pushed. Jaspar fell. Milo held on.
**[explosive]** They plunged through together.

**[hushed awe]** The void separated them. Each walked alone through their deepest fears.

**[darker shift]** Auren saw his forest burning. His people screaming. Thistle's face melting before him. A beautiful winged figure offered salvation—but when Auren declared "I will not save the chained one," the illusion shattered. For one searing moment, he glimpsed the truth: Tharizdun himself, a massive demon hanging in eight chains, his mere sight burning the eyes.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Milo found his family frozen in ice. A celestial promised to save them—together, if only he would follow. But Milo's mind is sharp. "Which god are you?" The being stumbled. Its face flickered. And Milo ran, screaming, into the dark.

**[shifting focus]** Jaspar's vision was gentler, and perhaps more dangerous for it. A house in Neverwinter. A crib. A woman singing a familiar lullaby. The winged being spoke of creation, of purpose: "You were so little when I found you." Jaspar learned what he was—an Aasimar, made in the image of something divine. The being offered everything. Jaspar asked only for time.

**[mysterious tone]** All three rejected the void's temptations. All three fell through darkness and found themselves on a snow-covered mountain top.
**[pause]** And there, frozen mid-struggle, were Liora and a woman in dark clothing—Cora—reaching for a hammer embedded in the mountain floor.

**[hushed awe]** The hammer pulsed. Ice exploded outward in waves—the same waves that had frozen the land. Each pulse brought a moment of life to the frozen figures before trapping them again. Above, a white dragon swooped to attack—and a wave of ice caught its wing, sending it plummeting down the mountainside.

**[bringing together]** Each hero had walked through their own hell and emerged changed. Milo, logic his shield against deception, protecting his sister's secret even as he discovered her crime. Jaspar, newly awakened to celestial blood, given time to decide his fate. Auren, having looked upon Tharizdun himself and lived to tell of it.
**[final words, heavy]** The hammer pulses still. Liora remains frozen. And somewhere in the void, false gods wait for another chance.
**[pause]** The dragon has fallen, but not died.
**[whispered]** And the question remains: who is the man that must not be released?
