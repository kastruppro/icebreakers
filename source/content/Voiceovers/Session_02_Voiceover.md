# Session 2 Voiceover: "Frozen Forest, Frozen Sea"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session 2: *"Frozen Forest, Frozen Sea."*

**[beat]** Morning came to Phandalin, though the sun brought no warmth. The wounded still lay scattered across the Stonehill Inn's floor, recovering from the dragon's devastation. Toblen, grateful and generous despite his losses, offered the party breakfast and a place to rest. But rest was not what they sought.

**[pause]** Outside, townsfolk remained frozen in ice - monuments to the dragon's cruelty. At the Shrine of Luck, Sister Gale knelt before the thirty-foot statue of Tymora, her prayers desperate whispers against the cold. She gave what she could - thirty goodberries and a single healing potion. Auren placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. "Tymora has done all she can through you, Sister."

**[warmer tone]** The party gathered supplies from Henrik's cluttered shop - rope, sleeping bags with holes and dust. Simple things. Necessary things. They filled their waterskins and turned west, toward the forest, toward the unknown.

**[darker shift]** The deeper they ventured, the stranger the forest became. Hoofbeats echoed from everywhere and nowhere. Then came the roar - that familiar, terrible sound from the east. The ground trembled. Trees froze in an instant. Ice spikes erupted from the earth as the party leaped aside, the dragon's magic reaching for them even from miles away.

**[building emotion]** Through the chaos, they heard voices ahead. Centaurs - ten of them frozen solid in a clearing. Their leader, Keelik, stood among them, desperate and grieving. They had fled south from the dragon's domain, only to be caught by this unnatural cold.

**[pause]** But it was not the centaurs that stole Modred's breath.

**[voice breaking slightly]** Among the frozen figures stood a man. Red hair. Dark, empty eyes. Around his neck hung a spiral symbol on a chain. Arthur De Moray. Modred's brother.

**[softer]** The knight slammed his sword into the frozen earth, fury and grief warring across his face. A red-purple substance writhed within the ice around Arthur's body, pressing against its frozen prison, trying to escape. Modred placed his hand against the cold surface, searching for answers that wouldn't come.

**[beat]** Milo approached carefully, pulling his pocket watch from his coat. He pressed it to the ice - an experiment, a hope. The substance turned toward it briefly, curious, before losing interest. Whatever possessed Arthur cared nothing for time magic.

**[darker shift]** But there was no time to linger. Keelik spoke of a divine humming to the north - a sound that had haunted the forest for a week. He led them through darkening trees, the sound growing louder, more beautiful, more impossible to resist.

**[hushed awe]** In a clearing, by an ancient tree, sat a nymph. Naked. Singing. Her voice pulled at their souls like fishing line.

**[building intensity]** The tree - a treant imprisoned in ice - shuddered free and grabbed Keelik in its roots. The nymph's scream shattered the peaceful facade before she returned to her enchanting song. Modred's eyes glazed as the charm took hold. In his mind, he was no longer in the forest - he stood in Waterdeep, his father's disappointed voice echoing through marble halls.

**[explosive]** Milo moved fast. Web sprayed from his fingers, pinning the nymph to the tree. Auren's bonfire ignited beneath her, the flames catching the sticky strands. She burned. And Modred, drawn by her magic even as she died, stepped close and took her head with a single stroke.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** The treant stood free at last, his ancient voice heavy with gratitude. "Thank you for freeing me from monster." But his confusion ran deep - he had no memory of his captivity. "Something is wrong with me," he admitted.

**[beat]** More troubling still were his words about another visitor. Someone who looked like Modred had passed through days ago, traveling from the east. Arthur. Arthur had walked this path before the ice took him.

**[pause]** Keelik did not survive. The treant, under the nymph's control, had killed him before the party could intervene.

**[bringing together]** With grief behind them and mystery ahead, the party followed the stream westward. The water grew colder as they walked. Then it turned to ice. And then they emerged from the forest to find the truth.

**[final words, heavy]** The ocean. The entire ocean had frozen solid.

**[long pause]** Milo carried questions about the spiral symbol and the substance that lived inside Arthur. Modred carried something heavier - the knowledge that his brother had been here, had been traveling somewhere, had been caught by something terrible. Auren carried the weight of comfort given and lives lost.

**[whispered]** And somewhere beneath miles of frozen sea, something waited. The dragon's power was greater than any of them had imagined. How far did this ice stretch? What lay at its heart? And what was the red-purple thing that wanted so badly to be free?

The answers lay somewhere in Neverwinter. If they could reach it.
