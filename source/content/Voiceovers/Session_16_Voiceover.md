# Session 16 Voiceover: "The Gauntlets of Tyr"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* -- Session 16: *"The Gauntlets of Tyr."*

**[beat]** Deeper into darkness they descended, three heroes without their fourth. Milo Swiftclock remained in Waterdeep, his absence a strange emptiness in the Temple of Tharizdun's suffocating depths. But Modred, Jaspar, and Clover pressed on -- following a chain through ancient corridors where no light had touched stone in centuries.

The chain led them to a room of levers and impossible gaps. **[pause]** A puzzle that demanded not strength, but patience.

**[warmer tone]** It was Clover who found the answer. Her form shifted, shrank -- eight legs where two had been, a spider now crawling across walls no human could climb. She reached the distant platform while Jaspar and Modred waited below, and together they learned what the temple demanded: not all things at once, but each in sequence. Raise the chain. Move it true. Then release.

**[softer]** The mechanism clicked. The chain found its hook. And deeper still they went.

**[darker shift]** The horned statue awaited them in the next chamber, its mouth a gateway for pale, reaching hands. A spirit, trapped between life and death, speaking in riddles of what it had lost.

*"When I was alive, I liked shiny things. Oh how I miss it so."*

Jaspar understood first. A ball bearing, enchanted with dancing light -- and the hands accepted their gleaming treasure.

**[building emotion]** *"When I was about to die, all I could see was red."*

Without hesitation, Jaspar drew his blade across his own palm. Blood dripped into waiting hands. **[beat]** The price of passage.

*"When I was dead, I missed the warmth."*

Modred stepped forward, torch blazing. Fire for a soul that had forgotten what it meant to feel.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** The statue crumbled to dust, its centuries of waiting finally ended. Whatever spirit had lingered there found its rest at last. **[voice breaking slightly]** Three offerings for three memories -- shining things, spilled blood, and borrowed warmth. The dead remember what the living forget to treasure.

**[adventure building]** The final door stood before them now. Two chains, two hooks, and beyond -- Tyr's Gauntlets, suspended in impossible stillness. But the Substance swirled around them, that same corruption they had fought before. It would not let them simply take what they sought.

**[building intensity]** Once more, Clover transformed. A spider so small she could fit in a palm. And Jaspar -- *Jaspar threw her*.

Through the barrier of corruption, through the writhing darkness, spider-Clover sailed. The Substance stirred, reaching, grasping -- but she was faster. Tiny legs found the gauntlets. Shifted back to harengon form. Thrust her hands inside.

**[explosive]** The gauntlets *transformed*, shrinking to fit her small frame. And in that moment, the Substance dissolved into nothing, its purpose ended, its prisoner freed.

**[pause]** Tyr's Gauntlets. Divine armor forged to fight the Chained One himself. Now in the hands of a rabbit who had refused to give up.

**[hushed awe]** Then came the black hound.

Tyr himself, god of justice, manifested before them in the same form he had taken before. His voice filled the chamber with purpose: *"Use the gauntlets to set Tharizdun further back into the world, and you will succeed."*

**[mysterious tone]** Four ruins. Four chains. Somewhere around Waterdeep, they waited -- but even Tyr did not know where. The party would have to find them themselves.

**[shifting focus]** But Clover was not finished. With courage that bordered on audacity, she asked for more. A boon. A blessing for her friends.

**[pause]** And Tyr, moved by her conviction, granted it to all four Icebreakers.

*The Boon of Tyr: sacrifice your own life force to save another, but take their wounds, their poison, their death itself upon yourself.*

**[bringing together]** Each hero emerged from that temple changed. Clover carried the gauntlets that would challenge a god. Jaspar bore scars on his palm where he had bled for passage. Modred had given warmth to a soul that had forgotten fire. And Milo, waiting in Waterdeep, would receive the same divine blessing his companions had earned.

**[final words, heavy]** But as they climbed from the darkness into forest light, they found they were not alone.

**[pause]** Cora stood in the clearing. The backflipping woman. The cultist. The one who had declared *"The Chained One has been released."*

She was clapping.

**[hushed]** Her eyes gleamed with something between triumph and hunger as she watched them emerge, Tyr's Gauntlets glinting on Clover's small hands. She was *excited*.

**[whispered]** The party had retrieved exactly what they came for. But as Cora's applause echoed through the trees, one question hung heavier than all the chains in Tharizdun's temple:

Was this what she wanted them to do all along?
