# Session 14 Voiceover: "Masquerade Preparations"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session Fourteen: *"Masquerade Preparations."*

**[beat]** The roar of the crowd still echoed through the Field of Triumph as dust settled on the arena floor. The The Icebreakers stood victorious, their opponents vanquished, the air thick with adulation. Modred raised his sword high, his voice cutting through the cheers like a blade through silk. "I am Modred De Moray of the House of De Moray. I'm back in the city. Remember this."

**[pause]** But not all eyes held warmth. In the announcer's box above, Victor Castellers sat motionless. He did not clap. He did not smile. He simply rose from his seat and walked away, leaving an absence that spoke louder than any words.

**[warmer tone]** With tickets to the Castellers Masquerade now in hand — a reward for their victory — the party scattered across Waterdeep on missions both practical and personal. At Gigz Gears, the industrious gnome had already perfected an improved ball bearing device in mere minutes. But it was her words about House Castellers that proved most valuable. They rose to power fast — too fast. Now they fund nearly everything in the city. And their children? No one had seen them for a very long time. Their parents, rumored to be depressed.

**[softer]** Jaspar's eyes narrowed. "Curious to suddenly go from nothing and having a lot of money. It might be not their money. They're just funneling it."

**[darker shift]** The threads of conspiracy were tightening, but the party had preparations of their own. Clover descended upon Savan's Magic Shop with an enthusiasm that bordered on possession — emerging with a Staff of the Python, a Hat of Vermin, and Gleaming Hide Armor that would never show a speck of dirt. Over a hundred gold, gone in minutes. "It's like poison to my mind," she admitted breathlessly. "You guys need to stop me from buying so much."

**[beat]** But it was her walk with Pogo that yielded darker intelligence. In Statue Square, pilgrims whispered of guards warning travelers away from the forest. Ruins with increased activity. A broken statue. Red and black robed cultists with eye symbols. And watching over it all — a dark-cloaked woman. Cora.

**[mysterious tone]** In the southern reaches of Waterdeep, Milo and Jaspar found Erik the Dwarf in his gem shop, surrounded by crystals that hummed with latent power. He examined the healing gem from Milo's mask with knowing eyes and spoke of conduit magic theory — how presenting magic with its opposite could invert its very nature. Healing touched by necromancy becoming something else entirely.

**[building emotion]** Jaspar leaned forward, a dangerous curiosity in his voice. "What if I used myself as the conduit?"

**[pause]** Erik paused, his hammer still. "Never heard someone ask about that before."

An apprenticeship was born. Training would begin the day after the masquerade. And in exchange, Erik held a necromantic gem — dark purple, 300 gold's worth of raw potential.

**[adventure building]** At Cece's shop, the party transformed. Jaspar emerged in black attire with a dragon cloak, wings spreading across his shoulders in gold. Milo chose teal green silk with a custom hat featuring ear holes for his harengon features. Modred donned purple silk with golden threads and fleur-de-lis patterns. And Clover wrapped herself in green and leaf, nature made manifest for a night among nobles.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Back at the Sated Satyr Inn, Modred stood before his mirror, corruption still darkening his fingers halfway up. He applied the Swift Flower treatment and spoke to himself with practiced determination. "You can do this. It's just another party. But this one — you really have to ruin it."

**[hushed awe]** The plan took shape. Objectives: understand the Castellers' wealth, find their missing children, establish cult connections, steal diamonds for resurrection. Each member had their role. Modred in a talkative mask would gather gossip while avoiding Victor. Jaspar in his dragon mask would be the distraction, courting attention and perhaps Victor's daughters. Milo behind a secretive blank mask would gather information from the shadows. And Clover, shy-masked, would slip through restricted areas in forms small enough to fit through keyholes.

**[beat]** Rules were established. Don't transform into animals — or at least don't be seen. Don't hit the host. Don't steal. Except, of course, from House Castellers.

**[building intensity]** As dawn broke, Jaspar cut his palm deliberately, watching as the wound knitted itself faster than any natural healing. He could feel his nerves reconnecting, a sensation that should have been impossible. Another mystery to add to the growing collection.

**[bringing together]** By afternoon, each hero carried their own burden into what lay ahead. Milo, ever practical, ensuring his spellbook could serve as arcane focus. Jaspar, pursuing power through paths no one had walked before. Modred, confronting his family's legacy in a city that had not forgotten. Clover, her shopping spree complete, her intelligence gathered, her forms ready for infiltration.

**[final words, heavy]** The sun began its descent toward evening. Somewhere across Waterdeep, House Castellers prepared to receive guests. Masks were being donned. Music was being tuned. And secrets — secrets old and terrible — waited in shadowed rooms for those bold enough to seek them.

**[pause]** The masquerade was hours away.

**[whispered]** What would the The Icebreakers find behind the masks of House Castellers? And more importantly — what would find them?
