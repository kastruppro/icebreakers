# Session 21 Voiceover: "Dream of Chains"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 21: *"Dream of Chains."*

**[beat]** The dream was burning. Walls of stone and fire pressed in around our heroes as they faced the beast—a creature of shifting elements, its body armored in rock, wreathed in flame. With every strike, it adapted. With every wound, it transformed. And in the oppressive heat of that nightmare realm, voices began to echo through the flames. A man's voice, desperate: *"You need to get out."* A woman's voice, warning: *"Victor is coming."*

**[pause]** The The Icebreakers had come for Thistle. And they would not leave without her.

**[building intensity]** Clover, still in wolf form, lunged at the beast with savage fury—a critical strike that sent blood spraying despite the creature's stony hide. But the beast answered with fire, its three heads breathing destruction across the chamber. Milo's magic missiles struck true while Jasper studied their foe, watching how it morphed and shifted. *"It adapts,"* he realized. *"Everything we do, it becomes something else."*

**[darker shift]** The battle became desperate. Fire breath scorched them all. Modric's blade glanced off stone armor. The beast seemed untouchable, unbreakable—looking as fresh as when they'd started despite blow after blow.

**[pause]** Then Clover stepped forward.

**[warmer tone]** Her wolf form dismissed, she approached Modric and placed her hand upon his sword. Cold energy flowed from her fingers, frost crackling along the blade. *"By the power of the Feywild,"* she whispered. And when Modric swung again, something changed.

**[building emotion]** The stone cracked. Ice spread across the beast's body, fighting the flames for dominance. The room itself split—fire on one side, ice on the other—as if reality couldn't contain them both. And through the cracks in that elemental armor, they finally saw blood. The beast could bleed.

**[explosive]** Modric hammered it again—a devastating critical strike, twenty-eight damage that sent cracks spider-webbing across its form. Clover hurled enchanted stones. And Milo, calling upon everything he had left, summoned one final fireball. The explosion consumed the beast entirely.

**[pause]** The scream that followed was not the beast's.

**[hushed awe]** It was Thistle's. Her voice, emerging from the dying creature's throat as the dream shattered around them. Reality fractured, and they fell—falling through nightmare and memory until—

**[beat]** They woke. The Castellers' bedroom. Children screaming.

**[building tension]** There was no time. Victor's footsteps echoed in the hall. Jasper moved to the children first, his voice impossibly calm, impossibly reassuring—a natural twenty that silenced their panic like a spell. Modric thrust his bonded sword through the door handles, buying precious seconds. And Milo's hands moved in arcane patterns as he called upon the vortex.

**[pause]** One spell. Two children, Thistle, and Modric—gone in a swirl of magic, deposited safely beyond the gates.

**[adventure building]** The rest had to run. Jasper's grappling hook found purchase on the windowsill. Clover and Jasper descended into the garden just as fireballs screamed past their heads. Victor had reached the window. Victor was shooting.

**[beat]** But Milo had hidden. In a bush in the garden below, he watched through his owl's eyes as something terrible happened.

**[darker shift]** The chains came for Victor Castellers. A red circle appeared beneath his feet, and from it erupted chains—chains that wrapped around his body, chains that dragged him toward a triangular portal that tore open in the air. His wife Ammalia tried to reach him, burned by every touch. His screams echoed across the courtyard.

**[pause]** And then he was gone. Claimed by Tharizdun. The deal was broken.

**[mysterious tone]** Through his owl, Milo flew deeper. Down into the basement where chanting filled the air. *"Tharizdun... Tharizdun..."* Eight cultists in a circle. Two druids with flowers in their hair. And in the center, chained and helpless—Lord Neverember himself. Still alive. Still imprisoned.

**[softer]** Ammalia found Milo in the garden. She told him everything—about Victor's deal with the four princes of Tharizdun, about the children who were meant to be part of it. She didn't know where her husband had gone. She only knew she needed to find her children.

**[beat]** Behind a painting in the study, Milo found a hidden room. A small shrine. A mysterious chest. He took it.

**[bringing together]** Out on the streets of Waterdeep, the party reunited. Clover transformed into a mighty warhorse, her sister Thistle finally safe upon her back alongside the rescued children. They moved through the night, toward the temple, toward safety.

**[final words, heavy]** Each hero carried their own weight. Milo, burdened by what his owl had seen—Lord Neverember in chains, a ritual still unfolding in darkness. Jasper, the calming voice that saved children from terror. Modric, the breaking point that shattered the beast's defenses. And Clover... Clover had her sister back. After everything, Thistle was free.

**[pause]** But the chains of Tharizdun reach far. And in the basement of House Castellers, the chanting continues still.

**[whispered]** Who are the four princes? And what was Lord Neverember meant to become?
