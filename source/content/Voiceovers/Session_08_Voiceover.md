# Session 8 Voiceover: "The Chained Released"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session Eight: *"The Chained Released."*

**[beat]** The summit of Icespire Peak. Wind howling against stone and bone. The party stood at the top of the world, breath crystallizing in the frigid air, the ancient dwarven hammer before them pulsing with something dark, something wrong. A strange substance coated its surface—and then the ground itself began to tremble.
**[pause]** They were not alone.

**[darker shift]** From the frozen earth, an ice giant rose. And with it, four skeletal warriors, their bones encased in frost, their hollow eyes fixed upon the living. Modred charged first, his blade singing through the air—but finding nothing. Jaspar seized the opening, landing a strike against the cold dead. But for every skeleton that fell, another rose the next moment, an endless cycle of death and resurrection.
**[building intensity]** Auren grabbed the hammer. It vibrated violently in his hands, but nothing changed. The ice creatures kept coming.

**[beat]** Then Milo saw it—the gem embedded in the hammer's head, pulsing with corrupt energy. He vortex-warped one of the ice elementals into the open air, sending it plummeting down the mountainside, buying them precious seconds. Another elemental materialized. They were running out of time.
**[explosive]** Auren drew his dagger and pried the gem free.

**[pause]** And everything stopped.

**[hushed awe]** The ice creatures crumbled. The skeletons collapsed into dust. The frozen prison that had held two figures captive for so long—shattered.
**[beat]** Two women emerged from the ice. One of them... was Liora Swiftclock.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** But the other—Cora—stood with dark purpose in her eyes. She looked at the party with something like satisfaction.
**[voice breaking slightly]** *"The chained one has been released."*
**[pause]** And with that, she threw herself backward into a triangular portal of her own making, disappearing with acrobatic grace. Gone. Just like that.

**[softer]** Liora collapsed. Tears streaming down her face. Milo ran to her, his sister, the one he'd searched for across frozen wastes and forgotten dungeons. She looked up at him with confusion, with pain.
**[beat]** *"Why did you break me free?"*
**[pause]** He had no answer. Only questions.

**[warmer tone]** She told him what she could. She had been having visions—dark prophecies that drove her to follow their parents' research. She had found Cora, and together they had stolen the hammer from Axeholm. But when they reached the summit, Cora began some enchantment. Liora tried to stop her.
**[darker shift]** And then she was frozen.

**[adventure building]** The descent brought new dangers. Bloody dragon footprints led into a cave. Jaspar, ever bold, attempted to sneak inside—only to be immediately spotted and mocked by the white dragon within. Milo entered to negotiate, but the others followed, and soon accusations flew.
**[building intensity]** Auren implied the dragon bore responsibility for the freeze. The dragon's patience wore thin. It spoke of eating them all.
**[beat]** Milo acted instantly—casting Hold Person on Auren, freezing their own companion before he could doom them all. They dragged him out while Modred stayed behind, flattering the beast, negotiating survival.
**[pause]** The dragon let them go. But it called them something.
*"Servants."*
It would call upon them if the ice returned.

**[softer]** Back in Phandalin, familiar faces waited. Mayor Toblen. Young Erik, who had delivered Milo's letters to Neverwinter and returned to find the heroes had already saved the world.
**[beat]** Milo pressed silver into the boy's hand. Bravery deserved reward.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** That night, in the quiet of their room, Milo and Liora talked. She spoke of a Great House in Waterdeep. A name—Godwen. They knew about the Chained. They might have answers.
**[pause]** It was a thread to follow. It would have to be enough.

**[mysterious tone]** And then, as sleep took him, Milo found himself somewhere between dream and waking. A stone face emerged from the ceiling—the visage of Oghma, God of Knowledge. The stone mouth moved.
**[whispered]** *"Find me when you come to Neverwinter. I have something for you... because of everything you set in motion."*

**[bringing together]** Each hero carried their own weight that day. Milo, reunited with his sister but burdened by the knowledge that their family's research runs deeper than he knew. Jaspar, who walked away with a corrupted gem—though Milo quickly relieved him of it. Modred, who bent knee to a dragon to save his friends. Auren, frozen by his own ally to prevent catastrophe.
**[final words, heavy]** They had stopped the freeze. They had saved a life. But something far worse had been set free.
**[pause]** Tharizdun. The Chained One.
**[whispered]** And somewhere, Cora was smiling.
