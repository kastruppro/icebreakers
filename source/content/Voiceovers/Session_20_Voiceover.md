# Session 20 Voiceover: "Into The Dream"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session Twenty: *"Into The Dream."*

**[beat]** The road from Daggerford had been long, winding through the coastal forests until the familiar spires of Waterdeep rose against the midday sky. Four adventurers passed through the eastern gates - weary, yes, but carrying something far heavier than exhaustion. They carried hope. A Dream Staff from Desna herself, given to them for a singular purpose: to save Thistle, trapped in a nightmare woven by the god of madness. **[pause]** But Waterdeep had dangers of its own waiting.

**[warmer tone]** In the graveyard beyond the city walls, they found the Daggers of the North. The mercenaries had just finished burying Rafael - their fallen warlock, returned at last to his hometown's soil. Merin, the tabaxi rogue, greeted them with somber nods. Old debts bind deeper than coin, and when the party asked for help infiltrating House Castellers, the Daggers agreed without hesitation. **[softer]** Some missions require more than muscle. They require friends who understand what's at stake.

**[darker shift]** But then came the pain - sudden, blinding, like a dagger thrust into Milo's skull. The wizard staggered, clutching his temples as visions of his own bag flashed before his eyes. Someone was tracking him. Someone who wanted what he'd taken. **[building emotion]** Through the alleys they scattered - Jaspar and Clover in pursuit of a woman in green who moved like smoke through the streets. Modred stayed with Milo, watching the chase unfold from a distance. And when Jaspar finally caught up, prepared to tackle their mysterious assailant - **[pause]** - she simply threw him aside like a child, fire already gathering in her palm.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** It was Clover, raging in bear form, who roared the accusation that mattered most: *"You can't go around and steal people's sisters!"* And something in Ammalia Castellers' eyes shifted. Not anger. Recognition. **[voice breaking slightly]** She too had lost children to the darkness that had taken Thistle. Victor, her husband, had made a deal with a demon. One month ago, their son and daughter fell into an endless sleep, and a Harengon appeared floating in their bedroom, channeling purple magic into their dreams. Ammalia hated Victor for what he'd done. And she wanted her children back.

**[adventure building]** An alliance was forged in that moment - fragile as glass, sharp as necessity. Ammalia would let them into House Castellers. The party would try to save her children alongside Thistle. **[building intensity]** That evening, they walked through the front gates like honored guests. Guards dismissed at Ammalia's command, instruments playing themselves on an empty platform, gardens beautiful but untended. The mansion held its breath as they climbed to the children's bedroom. **[explosive]** And when they entered - when they saw Thistle floating in purple light above the moaning children - the Dream Staff flared to life, and the world went white.

**[hushed awe]** They fell through whiteness that turned red, then purple, uncomfortable as a bruise against the soul. Before them stood Thistle - but wrong. Corrupted. Red-purple magic streaming from her hands into two terrified children, and when Clover rushed forward, the room stretched like taffy, separating sister from sister, family from family. **[pause]** The dream realm does not play fair.

**[mysterious tone]** Puzzles awaited them in Thistle's nightmare. A plaque that asked *"Do you trust your instincts?"* above three doors - and the screams that beckoned them led only in circles. Chests that contained mimics and teddy bears alike. Colored platforms that demanded opposite-colored toys to cross. And three jesters, each pointing to a different door, each claiming theirs led to Thistle. **[shifting focus]** Jaspar, faithful to Tymora's luck, flipped his coin three times and chose the middle door. Lady Luck rewarded his faith.

**[bringing together]** In the final chamber, they found her - truly found her. Thistle. But her body twisted, stretched, transformed into something monstrous. A chimera-beast with two tails, each bearing a terrible head. Fire and poison belched from its maws as combat began. **[final words, heavy]** Each hero carried their own weight into battle. Milo conjured mirror images, splitting himself into four. Modred stood strong with Protection from Evil and Good shimmering around him. Jaspar's blades were ready. And Clover - **[pause]** - Clover saw her sister's face twisted by something ancient and hungry.

**[pause]** The entity possessing Thistle had spoken to them through her corrupted mouth: *"I want your sister's magic. She's so powerful."* Something wanted Thistle's druidic power badly enough to trap her in this nightmare. Something connected to Victor's demon deal, to the sleeping children, to the ever-present threat of Tharizdun.

**[whispered]** In the heart of a dream, four heroes stand against a monster wearing a familiar face. Will they save Thistle? Will they wake the children? And what price will House Castellers demand for their help? The nightmare continues.
