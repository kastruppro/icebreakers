# Session 01 Voiceover: "The Dragon's First Pass"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Welcome to the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session One: *"The Dragon's First Pass."*

**[beat]** South of Neverwinter, a dusty road winds its way toward a frontier town few dare to visit anymore. Phandalin - a name whispered in taverns alongside rumors of strange happenings and darker things. Yet still, adventurers come. They always do. Seeking fortune, seeking answers, seeking something they cannot name.

**[pause]** Four strangers arrived that day, each walking their own path toward the same uncertain destination.

**[warmer tone]** First came a figure shrouded in mystery - a Reborn who called himself only "Isak." His eyes carried the weight of things he would not speak of, his manner guarded against questions he was not ready to answer. Then arrived Milo Swiftclock, a harengon wizard with soft beige fur and pale amber eyes that missed nothing. A child ran to him immediately, fascinated by his long ears, and Milo let her play - but even as he smiled, he pulled a worn poster from his pack. A drawing of another harengon. His sister. Missing.

**[beat]** "Have you seen her?" The question he would ask a hundred times more.

**[softer]** Auren Thalos swept into town next - an Eladrin sorcerer with black hair, a nobleman's confidence, and a scar beneath his cheek that hinted at stories untold. And finally, Sir Modred De Moray - a human knight clad entirely in black, chainmail gleaming, flail at his side. A man of noble blood with noble bearing.

**[darker shift]** Then the sky screamed.

**[building intensity]** A roar tore across the heavens from the northeast - from Mount Hotenow - and a shadow blotted out the sun. A dragon. White scales like frozen death, wings that churned the air into bitter cold. It passed over Phandalin heading west toward the forest, and in its wake came ice. Not ordinary ice - magical ice that spread like a disease through the streets, catching anyone too slow to flee.

**[pause]** The mother. The child who had just been laughing at Milo's ears. Frozen. Eyes still moving behind the crystalline prison. Alive, but trapped.

**[voice breaking slightly]** Milo tried everything. His dagger. His magic. He cast Detect Magic and recognized the signature - Evocation, similar to Hold Person, but something else entirely. Something he had never seen before.

**[softer]** Sister Gale, the town's half-elven cleric of Tymora, pressed her hands to the ice and prayed. Her magic found nothing it could grasp. When she pulled away, her face held only disappointment.

**[warmer tone]** But in the tavern, where frightened children huddled against their parents, Milo found something he could do. He let them play with his fur, his ears, had his owl perform acrobatics until they laughed. Until the adults breathed again.

**[building]** The Reborn spoke with Toblen, the mayor. He had seen this before - at Mount Hotenow, where his company and a band of orcs had been frozen just like this. But he never saw the dragon. It came, it froze, and it left only questions.

**[adventure building]** The party formed around a simple need: answers. Milo wrote letters to his old master and his friend Elira, begging for any knowledge about dragon magic. Auren demanded someone write to Lord Neverember. And when Toblen's nephew Erik ran off toward Neverwinter with their desperate messages, the four strangers became something more.

**[pause]** A party.

**[building intensity]** Twenty minutes from town lay the Digging Site, where dwarves and orcs stood at the edge of war. The party left their weapons at the entrance and walked into a room thick with tension. Grom, the dwarf leader. Krikk, the orc chieftain. Two peoples who should have been enemies, both fleeing the same dragon.

**[beat]** Auren spoke of cooperation, of shared survival. His words were good - but not quite good enough. And then Milo reached into time itself, found the thread of possibility, and pulled.

**[explosive]** Chronal Shift. The dice tumbled differently. And suddenly, Krikk was nodding.

**[softer]** The orcs spoke of Talos, the god of thunder. Of a ritual to summon a thunderbear - a creature of divine fury that might be able to kill even a dragon. They had never done it before. A last resort, they said.

**[bringing together]** The party returned to Phandalin with pelts and lanterns from the grateful dwarves, their next destination decided - the forest to the west, where other threats lurked. Toblen offered wine. Sir Modred, ever the noble, declared it swill. Milo and Auren thought it was fine.

**[darker shift]** But that night, as Isak slept, the darkness found him. A void without light. A voice echoing - "Abomination. Abomination." And then he saw her: the Raven Queen, tears of blood streaming from her eyes.

**[whispered]** "You're not worthy of life."

**[pause]** He woke sitting upright, something fundamental taken from him.

**[final words, heavy]** Four strangers had become four companions. A dragon circled somewhere in the mountains. The people of Phandalin remained frozen. And one among them carried a curse he could not escape.

**[whispered]** The adventure had only just begun.
