# Session 22 Voiceover: "Sanctuary and Strategy"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session Twenty-Two: *"Sanctuary and Strategy."*

**[beat]** Evening had fallen over Waterdeep when the The Icebreakers scattered through its streets, their precious cargo in tow. Clover, still in the form of a great warhorse, bore two frightened children and her sister—her sister, finally awake after weeks of enchanted sleep—toward the Temple of Tyr. Behind her, Jaspar and Modred kept pace. And across the city, Milo slipped through the crowds with Ammalia Castellers, the woman whose husband had betrayed his own family to a dark god.

**[pause]** Two paths. One purpose. And somewhere beneath House Castellers, Lord Neverember remained chained in a ritual circle, time running out.

**[warmer tone]** At the temple, Clover wasted no time. She dragged Thistle to Morgane—Modred's mother, a priestess of Tyr—and begged her to examine her sister for any corruption. Light emanated from Morgane's hands as she worked, and after long, anxious moments, she gave her verdict: Thistle was unharmed. No magic. No taint. Nothing within her.

**[voice breaking slightly]** Clover dropped to her knees. She thanked Silvanus, the Oak Father, for protecting what she could not. And then came the harder conversation—telling Thistle about the Moonlit Pool's destruction. About their parents.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** "I saw them," Clover whispered, "traveling to the afterlife." Thistle questioned whether they might still be alive. Clover wiped away a tear and made a promise she intended to keep: *"With our parents gone, the role falls to us. I will teach you the ways."* The sisters grieved together, two druids now carrying the weight of a legacy that had been stolen from them.

**[darker shift]** Meanwhile, a black dog with golden eyes watched Modred from across the temple. He knew this sign—had seen it before. Slowly, he approached, following the creature toward the massive statue of Tyr. And when he looked up, the statue's eye blinked.

**[hushed awe]** Light consumed him. Modred found himself transported to a divine workshop—a realm of tools and weapons and purpose. There, the god of justice delivered his warning: *"Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God. You need to act swiftly soon. Otherwise Tharizdun will destroy the whole world."*

**[beat]** Tyr felt great power building somewhere within Waterdeep's walls. And the temple ruins south of Daggerford—the chains that bound Tharizdun—still awaited destruction. Time pressed from every direction.

**[shifting focus]** At the Sated Satyr, Milo navigated the tavern with Ammalia at his side. The music stopped when they entered. Patrons stared—some with disgust, others with the gleam of scandal. Ammalia bore it with practiced grace, though she whispered to Milo: *"Let's find a place to sit."*

**[beat]** Raenar Neverember waited in a corner with his dog Pogo, and Milo wasted no time gathering what allies he could. When Jaspar and Modred arrived with news—*"Your kids are safe, they're at the temple"*—Ammalia's relief was palpable. But uncertainty followed. *"Have you ever met someone where your entire life just revolves around them?"* she asked. *"I don't know what to do."*

**[adventure building]** The party regrouped at the temple for a strategy session. Walking through the streets with Ammalia proved eventful—Modred's attempt to intimidate gawkers failed so spectacularly that children laughed at him. But Jaspar smoothed things over with his natural charm.

**[darker shift]** Then came the bottle. It shattered against the temple wall as someone screamed *"Child killer!"* from the gathering mob. Guards dispersed the crowd, but the message was clear: the Castellers name had become poison in Waterdeep.

**[building intensity]** Inside, Milo revealed what he had discovered in the Castellers basement: Lord Neverember, chained in a summoning circle, surrounded by eight to ten cultists performing a Tharizdun ritual. The party debated their options—go now, depleted and vulnerable, or rest and risk losing their window. In the end, wisdom won over urgency.

**[beat]** They would rest until four in the morning, then strike.

**[softer]** But before sleep claimed them, Morgane pulled Modred aside. *"Your dad was here some days ago,"* she said. *"He asked for you specifically."*

**[pause]** Modred's response came flat and cold: *"Last time I went to see him, he tried to kill me."*

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Yet Morgane pressed on. Godwin had been sober. He didn't look good, but he had been sober. For the first time anyone could remember.

**[bringing together]** As night deepened over Waterdeep, each hero found their rest. Milo examined the mysterious locked shrine he'd taken from Castellers, setting it aside for later. Jaspar slipped away to the comfortable beds at the Sated Satyr. Modred contemplated a god who kept appearing to him despite his lack of faith. And Clover gathered sticks and leaves to make a traditional druid bed for Thistle, then caught one last look at her sleeping sister before allowing herself, for the first time in weeks, to feel something like peace.

**[final words, heavy]** They awoke stronger. Level six. Spells restored. Ready.

**[pause]** The Daggers of the North kept watch on House Castellers through the night. Somewhere in that basement, Lord Neverember remained chained to darkness. And in the shadows of the world, Tharizdun moved ever faster.

**[whispered]** Four in the morning approaches. The The Icebreakers prepare to descend once more into the dark. Will they be in time?
