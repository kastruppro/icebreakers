# Session 9 Voiceover: "Shadows and Elections"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session 9: *"Shadows and Elections."*

**[beat]** Morning light filtered through the windows of Toblen's inn in Phandalin, catching dust motes that danced above the breakfast table where three adventurers sat in exhausted silence. The walls around them still bore the scars of recent repairs, workers hammering in the distance as the town slowly pieced itself back together. But some damage cannot be hammered away. Some wounds are carried in the mind. **[pause]** The void had shown each of them things. Terrible things. Things they were only now beginning to speak aloud.

**[warmer tone]** Jaspar was the first to break the silence, his silver hair catching the light as he leaned forward. He told them he wasn't entirely human - the truth finally spoken after all they'd endured together. Across the table, Liora - Milo's sister, rescued from ice and darkness - spoke of an old man corrupted by powers beyond mortal understanding. A name fell from her lips that made Modred go very still: *Godwen.* His father. **[softer]** The web of connection between their fates drew ever tighter.

**[darker shift]** With leather armor purchased for his sister and purpose renewed in their hearts, the party rode into the forest once more. They were searching for Arthur - Modred's younger brother, lost to forces they didn't yet understand. **[building emotion]** What they found instead was horror. A centaur came flying through the trees toward them, its body tumbling end over end before coming to rest with its head rolling separately across the forest floor. **[pause]** And there, standing amid the carnage, was the woman they'd come to call the backflipping bitch. *Cora.* And suspended in her magic, eyes vacant and distant - Arthur.

**[tense]** Cora spoke with a serpent's smile. She claimed she was *saving* him. Helping him. The party did not believe her. But when Milo and the others attacked, something terrible happened - every blow that struck Cora seemed to wound Arthur instead. Some dark magic had bound them together. **[beat]** In desperation, Milo reached into his arcane knowledge and cast Vortex Warp, hurling Cora away through twisted space. When they rushed to where she'd landed, she was simply... gone. Vanished like smoke on the wind.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** With Cora fled, Modred finally stood before his brother. The reunion was bittersweet - Arthur spoke of their father, of training that felt more like imprisonment, of rumors of a cult in a nearby forest that he and Godwen had investigated. **[voice breaking slightly]** But after that? Nothing. Arthur couldn't remember anything after finding the cultists at their ritual. Only fragments. Brief moments of awakening in what felt like an endless sleep. He didn't even remember Cora. Whatever had been done to him had stolen pieces of his very self.

**[adventure building]** The party pressed on to Neverwinter, bringing both Arthur and Liora to what they hoped would be safety. But safety was in short supply in the city of the Never. **[pause]** As they approached, they witnessed something that stopped them in their tracks. The Castle of Neverwinter, which had fallen into ruin when the ice came, was rising. Stone by stone, it reassembled itself, lifted by invisible hands of impossible power. And at the center of this magical display stood Sebastian - the mage who had won the recent election. **[hushed]** Milo felt it immediately. The tingling wrongness of chronurgy magic. Time magic. The same kind of power connected to the frozen world and the cult.

**[shifting focus]** They found Liset in the streets, the woman who had run against Sebastian. Her voice was bitter with defeat - the first election had been a tie, but somehow the re-vote was a landslide in Sebastian's favor. Only the wizards could make change now, she said. The common people had no voice. The party promised to investigate, but avoided Sebastian himself for now. There were other allies to consult first.

**[building intensity]** At the House of Knowledge - Oghma's temple - they found Gearwhistle, the gnome artificer who had mentored Milo. Professor Blackthorn lurked outside the door, watching with eyes that held secrets. Inside a magically secured room, the party finally unburdened themselves of everything: Axeholm, the mountain top, the void, the fear that they had released something far worse than ice upon the world. **[beat]** Gearwhistle listened. And he agreed to investigate whether Sebastian might be under some dark influence.

**[explosive]** But first - Arthur. The curse that bound him needed to be broken. Gearwhistle reached out with his magic, probing the darkness within the young man. Something resisted. Something pushed back. And then - **[pause]** - something emerged. A shape of pure shadow, human-formed and terrible, pulled itself from Arthur's body like a spider crawling from an egg. It perched upon his shoulders, and when Arthur opened his eyes, they were pitch black as the void itself.

**[bringing together]** Three heroes had walked into that room seeking answers. **[pause]** Milo, still carrying the weight of his sister's rescue. Jaspar, finally honest about who he truly was. Modred, reunited with a brother he might already be losing.

**[final words, heavy]** They had sought to cure Arthur. Instead, they had awakened something that had been sleeping inside him all along.

**[whispered]** And it was looking right at them.
