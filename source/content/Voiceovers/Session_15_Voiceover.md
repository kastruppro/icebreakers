# Session 15 Voiceover: "Into the Chained One's Temple"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 15: *"Into the Chained One's Temple."*

**[beat]** The sun hung high over Waterdeep as the The Icebreakers made a decision that would take them into darkness. With the masquerade ball mere hours away, they chose to venture first into the forest — to the cult ruins that had haunted Modred's family for generations. *"Good warm up,"* the knight had said, *"before going to the party and trash it."* But there would be nothing warm about what awaited them below.
**[pause]** Through the familiar forest path they traveled, past toxic berries that promised madness, until they found what remained of the cultist they'd left behind — a body now missing its leg, gore scattered where predators had feasted.

**[darker shift]** Clover knelt beside the carnage, reading nature's brutal story. A bear, she determined — natural scavenging, nothing more sinister. But the bodies of the cultists they themselves had killed? Those were simply *gone*. Drag marks led into the forest's deeper shadows, and none dared follow that trail. The owl Tock, Milo's faithful familiar, soared ahead through the canopy, discovering what lay ahead: an elevated platform, scattered corpses, and an ancient altar demanding a price in blood.

**[building emotion]** At the blood altar, Milo looked down at his fur and shook his head. *"There will be blood in my fur,"* he protested. But Modred — Modred understood sacrifice in ways the others couldn't. Without hesitation, the knight drew his blade across his own palm, watching crimson drip onto the stone circle. The same ruins where his father had failed. The same darkness that had swallowed Arthur before. And now Modred's blood joined theirs, awakening an ancient mechanism.
**[pause]** The floor dropped beneath them.

**[adventure building]** Down, down they descended, into a temple carved from shadow itself. The elevator deposited them in a massive chamber dominated by a single, terrible sight: a giant statue of Tharizdun, the Chained One, bound by links of iron that stretched in every direction — to the walls, to the ceiling, into the very stone itself. Milo followed one chain to the right, leading his companions into a well chamber where their true test waited.
**[beat]** Three chains hung from the walls like levers. Three hooks opposite them. And somewhere below, in a well dropping hundreds of feet into darkness, something waited to be raised.

**[building intensity]** They pulled together — Milo, Modred, and Clover each gripping a chain. The moment they did, oozes dropped from above. Three writhing masses of corruption that absorbed their blows and kept coming. They destroyed them, but when they tried the chains again — the oozes reformed, more hungry than before.
**[pause]** It took Milo's quick thinking to solve it. One person holds the chain. The others fight. Secure it before the oozes regenerate. Again. And again. And again.

**[explosive]** Then came the final wave. A massive Oblex dropped into the chamber, trailing three smaller oozes in its wake. And from its translucent body emerged something horrifying — *another Milo*. A perfect duplicate, memories stolen, spells copied, moving with the chronurgy wizard's own grace as it turned its magic against its original.
**[hushed awe]** But Milo was ready. Mirror Image sprung into existence around him, illusory doubles absorbing the duplicate's attacks while the real Milo fought back. The battle stretched on, brutal and exhausting, until at last every ooze lay destroyed.

**[softer]** In the silence that followed, they could hear it — the mechanism had worked. Something had been raised from the depths of that endless well. Something the chains had guarded for centuries. Something that might finally complete Tyr's divine quest.
**[pause]** But the temple was not yet done with them. More chambers waited. More puzzles. More guardians.

**[bringing together]** Each hero had carried their weight through the darkness. Milo, scouting with Tock and outsmarting his own magical reflection. Modred, bleeding for the cause as his family had bled before him, fighting through ruins that echoed with failure. Clover, reading the natural world's clues and standing strong when the oozes came wave after wave.
**[beat]** And somewhere in Waterdeep, Jaspar worked on mysterious devices with Gigz, unaware of the horrors his companions had faced below the forest floor.

**[final words, heavy]** The Chained One's temple had tested them. It had stolen their resources, pushed their limits, and shown them the face of a god who should never be freed. The first puzzle was complete — but only the first.
**[pause]** Above, the masquerade ball awaited. House Castellers. Thistle. Secrets waiting to be uncovered.
**[whispered]** But first... what prize lay waiting at the bottom of that well? And would they claim it before the sun set over Waterdeep?
