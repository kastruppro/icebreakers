# Session 10 Voiceover: "Divine Intervention"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session 10: *"Divine Intervention."*

**[beat]** The shadow rose from Arthur like smoke from dying embers, half-within and half-without, dragging him through the air and into the sacred chapel of Oghma. The flickering torchlight caught the silhouette of something ancient and hungry as it settled atop the statue of the god of knowledge himself. Below, our heroes followed, breath caught in their throats, weapons drawn against an enemy that had no true form.
**[pause]** And in the doorway stood a stranger - another Harengon, ears drooped low, covered in silk.

**[warmer tone]** Clover had wandered far from his home, from the Moonwell Pool in the Feywild where his family once stood as protectors. Now they were gone, and the portal had brought him here - into chaos, into battle, into a destiny he never asked for. As the shadow screamed overhead, this small rabbit-folk shifted his form into a giant spider and shot webs at the flying horror.
**[softer]** Sometimes family finds you in the strangest places.

**[darker shift]** The shadow struck back with terrible magic. One by one, our heroes fell into visions - traps woven from their own memories. Clover was cast back to the Feywild, to a home that no longer waited for him. Modred found himself in Waterdeep, and the screams that tore from his throat echoed with old wounds. Jaspar saw Brost by a bonfire in Neverwinter, a moment of peace stolen from a life of running.
**[building emotion]** And Milo - Milo stood atop the mountain where he had freed his sister, but now it was empty. Everyone he had fought for, simply... gone.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Yet even as their minds scattered across illusions, their bodies continued to fight. Jaspar, ever quick, cast light upon a simple ball bearing - and when it struck true, the shadow screamed in agony. Light. The oldest enemy of darkness.
**[voice breaking slightly]** Some battles are won not with steel, but with the simplest magic of all.

**[adventure building]** Modred, fighting through his own nightmare of Waterdeep, reached his brother. Grabbed him. Dragged him screaming into the circle of light the party had created. The shadow retreated into Arthur's body, but something was wrong - Gearwhistle confirmed what they feared. The shadow was not merely possessing him.
**[building intensity]** It was tethered. Bound.
**[explosive]** "He will make a fine vessel for Tharizdun," it had said.
And in that moment, the full weight of their enemy's plan became clear.

**[hushed awe]** As the battle ended and Sebastian arrived to calm the crowds outside, Milo turned to the statue of Oghma. Anger in his voice. Demand in his heart. "Is this what you meant?" he shouted. "I have something for you?"
**[mysterious tone]** Silence at first. Then a presence. A whisper that became a pull, and Milo found himself standing in a throne room of pure white light.
**[pause]** Oghma himself had answered.

**[bringing together]** "I would like to help," the god said, "but I am not allowed by the ancient rules for Celestials." Yet even gods, it seems, can bend rules for those with courage enough to demand answers. Milo received the gift of Fey Touched - magic to walk between worlds.

And later, at the Swiftclock home, the final truths emerged. Milo's parents - Serina and Ren - finally spoke of their family's generational burden. The cult of Tharizdun had been studied by the Swiftclocks for generations. Milo's grandfather had walked through a portal... and never returned.
**[final words, heavy]** Tharizdun is the Chained One. The portals to the Void can be navigated by speaking your destination aloud. But the more you travel through that darkness, the more of yourself you leave behind.

**[pause]** Milo, learning his family had always known more than they admitted. Jaspar, selling Liora's hammer to Sebastian for six hundred gold, secrets kept about the gem's true location. Modred, his brother possessed by something that wants to make him a vessel for a god of madness. Clover, sleeping in the park as a dog, because even after finding companions, the wild still calls to those who have lost everything.

**[whispered]** They will go to Waterdeep. By portal. Through the Void itself. Arthur must stay behind - they cannot risk feeding him to the darkness.

But somewhere, Tharizdun waits in chains that grow weaker. And the shadow in Arthur waits with him.
