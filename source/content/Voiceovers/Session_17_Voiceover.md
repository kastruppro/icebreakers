# Session 17 Voiceover: "The Masquerade Ball"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 17: *"The Masquerade Ball."*

**[beat]** The elevator groaned upward through ancient stone, carrying four heroes and the sacred gauntlets of Tyr. Light filtered through the temple ruins above—freedom, so close they could taste it. But as the platform settled and the The Icebreakers stepped into the open air... **[pause]** ...slow, mocking applause greeted them.

**[darker shift]** Cora sat waiting on broken stone, flanked by four cultists in colored robes. Her smile was knowing. *"Impressive,"* she purred, eyes settling on Modred's hand. **[beat]** *"Ah, so it has begun already. I see that you have taken the gift of Faisten. I see that you have embraced it."*

**[building intensity]** She demanded Arthur's location. Clover had other ideas—spike growth erupted beneath the cultists as chaos descended. Jaspar's blade sang against an orange-robed mage. Milo's mirrors shimmered into existence. **[explosive]** But these cultists dealt in death itself—necrotic energy surged through a white-robed figure's touch, and Modred staggered as thirty-one points of his life force simply... vanished.

**[beat]** Still they fought. Milo's gravity magic crushed Cora and her summoned bats. Then—*Tasha's Hideous Laughter*—and the villain collapsed in helpless spasms while the wizard taunted her about Arthur hiding at *"your mom's place."*

**[pause]** One by one, the cultists fell. Clover's magic stone struck the final blow. But Cora—always Cora—traced a triangle in the air. **[darker shift]** *"I think I know where your brother is anyway,"* she smiled, and stepped through reality itself, spike growth tearing at her even as she escaped.

**[warmer tone]** The party raced to Waterdeep's House of Justice. Morgane provided a Sending spell, and Modred's warning crackled across the miles to Arthur: *"Flee Neverwinter. Hide somewhere else. Don't tell us where. Bring your furry friend. She knows hiding spots."* **[beat]** Arthur's reply was... less than reassuring: *"Who are the icebreakers?"*

**[softer]** A second message set things right—ending with Modred's assessment of Cora as *"a backflipping bitch."* Healing potions pressed into their hands, armor upgraded for Jaspar, and a brief rest taken in sacred halls. **[pause]** Then—the masquerade awaited.

**[adventure building]** House Castellers rose before them in evening splendor. An arrogant butler inspected their invitations with barely concealed disdain before presenting masks—red and flirty for Clover, blue and shy for Milo, black and secretive for Modred. **[beat]** Then, announced to the assembled nobility: *"The The Icebreakers!"* Applause rippled through the crowd.

**[building emotion]** But this was no celebration. Other guests drew the party's attention—the Daggers of the North, arena champions from Daggerford, wearing patches marked with a strange salt symbol. And then... Sebastian. Arrived from Neverwinter—a journey of seven days by ship—impossibly, impossibly fast.

**[darker shift]** Clover moved with purpose. A staged stumble, a grabbed arm, and Sebastian's glove came away revealing... **[pause]** ...his entire hand, black as midnight. Not fingertips like Modred. Not spreading corruption. Complete, total consumption.

**[hushed awe]** Sebastian's eyes went wide. He moved immediately to Victor Castellers, and Clover watched their lips move from across the room. **[beat]** *"We have been compromised."* Victor's masked face twisted with anger. *"Just leave the party now and meet me downstairs."*

**[building intensity]** Both men departed separately. Clover slipped away—through the gardens, into the outhouse, shifting down into the form of a small brown rat. Milo conjured fart sounds and smells to distract a nearby guard. **[beat]** But fortune was not kind. Two rolls. Two threes. Even Milo's Chronal Shift couldn't save the dice.

**[explosive]** A guard's boot connected with supernatural force—a natural twenty—and Clover the rat went sailing over the mansion gates to land in a Waterdeep alley, four points of damage forcing her back to harengon form. **[pause]** Bystanders screamed at the sudden appearance of a rabbit-woman.

**[bringing together]** And so the The Icebreakers find themselves split. Clover stands in an alley outside the mansion walls, panicking citizens fleeing around her. Inside, Milo, Modred, and Jaspar remain among the masked elite, knowing now that Sebastian and Victor conspire together—knowing something waits *downstairs.*

**[final words, heavy]** The gift of Faisten spreads. Sebastian's corruption runs deeper than any of them feared. The Daggers of the North wear symbols of salt. Triangular portals tear through reality. And somewhere, Arthur runs—hopefully toward safety, though Cora claimed to know where Modred's brother hides.

**[pause]** Trust no one behind the masks.

**[whispered]** What secrets lie beneath House Castellers... and how long before the corruption claims them all?
