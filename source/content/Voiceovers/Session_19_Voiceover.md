# Session 19 Voiceover: "The Dream Staff"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 19: *"The Dream Staff."*

**[beat]** Morning light filtered through the windows of the Sated Satyr Inn. The masquerade was over, the masks set aside, but the mysteries remained. Jaspar found a pink envelope waiting for him — perfumed paper and magical pepper nuts from Isabella Adabrent, a noblewoman whose dance he would not soon forget. The party gathered around a table scattered with curious treats, each nut holding unpredictable magic. Jaspar floated toward the ceiling. Milo's voice boomed without warning. Modred shrank to half his size. Even Raenar ate one and vanished entirely. **[pause]** But laughter would soon give way to purpose.

**[warmer tone]** The Daggers of the North arrived — fellow adventurers hunting the same darkness. Moguna, their elven paladin, extended trust easily, believing the best in strangers. Leena the dwarf druid kept her hand near her axe, suspicious eyes tracking every spell Clover cast. Merin the tabaxi rogue said little, uncertain which way the wind would blow. They spoke of Rafael, their fallen companion — a warlock plagued by nightmares of chains and demons, killed fighting a corrupted beast in the marshes near Daggerford. **[softer]** The same purple-red corruption the party knew too well. The same enemy. Different faces of the same war.

**[darker shift]** Milo reached out with Detect Thoughts, carefully reading the minds of their potential allies. Moguna's thoughts rang genuine — naive perhaps, but pure of intent. Leena's suspicion was protective, not hostile. Merin's caution was the wariness of experience, not malice. They could be trusted. But trust came with revelations: cult ruins in the southern marshes, another of Tharizdun's chains waiting to be found and destroyed. The path forward fractured into too many directions. **[beat]** First, though — Jaspar had a promise to keep.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** The party made their way to House Adabrent, hoping to see Isabella. But the guards at the noble estate stood unmoved by charm or request. No appointment, no entry. Clover, ever resourceful, convinced one guard to try a pepper nut. The poor man found himself expelling snowflakes from an unfortunate location while his legs turned partially to stone. **[voice breaking slightly]** The laughter felt good. These moments of absurdity reminded them why they fought — for a world worth laughing in.

**[adventure building]** With Waterdeep behind them, Clover transformed into a magnificent warhorse, carrying all three companions toward Daggerford. An hour's journey brought them to a town in celebration. Banners flew. Children ran through streets decorated with drawings of heroes — the Daggers of the North, celebrated for slaying the beast that had terrorized the region. The Day of the Feast filled the air with joy the party could only observe from the edges. **[building intensity]** They were not here for celebration. They were here for the Temple of Desna.

**[hushed awe]** The temple was dim, its ceiling painted with constellations that seemed to shift and breathe. White cloudy substance drifted overhead like captured dreams. A priestess in purple robes, moon symbols glowing on her hands, welcomed them to the Circle of Sleep. The party lay down among sheets meant for meditation, and consciousness slipped away into something deeper. **[mysterious tone]** When they opened their eyes, they stood in a space between stars. And before them — a face made of constellations, hair like clouds of starlight. Desna. The goddess of dreams herself.

**[shifting focus]** She saw everything. Thistle, trapped in nightmare, held by Tharizdun's own spell — no mortal magic could break it. The ruins in the marsh held one of the chains that bound the god of decay. Tyr's gauntlets could shatter them. She read the dreams of those the party asked about: Raenar dreamed only of reuniting with his father. Modred's father Godwin drowned in guilt, hatred, and shame. Cora — the backflipping cultist they despised — dreamed only of destruction and hate. **[pause]** And Jaspar's prophetic dreams? Even Desna could not fully see them. They existed in a space between her realm and something else entirely.

**[bringing together]** Then came the gift. A staff of beautiful glass, shimmering with dream-light — the Dream Staff. "This you can use to enter the nightmares of your sister," Desna told Clover. "And hopefully free her. However... if you fail in the dream, it is impossible to get out." Clover did not hesitate. "Whatever the price is, I'm willing to pay it." The goddess smiled, starlight playing across her celestial features. "The whole fate of the world lies in all of your hands. No pressure."

**[final words, heavy]** Each hero carried their own burden from that temple. Milo, blessed with better sleep, his analytical mind validated by divine acknowledgment. Jaspar, learning his visions transcended even the goddess of dreams. Modred, understanding now the depths of his father's torment. And Clover — holding a staff that could save Thistle or trap them both forever. **[pause]** The plan crystallized: infiltrate House Castellers, reach Thistle, enter her nightmare. The Daggers of the North would provide distraction. Milo's teleportation would breach the defenses.

**[whispered]** But success in the waking world would only be the beginning. The true battle awaited in dreams — where failure meant eternal imprisonment, and the chains of Tharizdun grew ever tighter around the world.
