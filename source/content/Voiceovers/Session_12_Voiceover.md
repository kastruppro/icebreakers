# Session 12 Voiceover: "Waterdeep Arrival and Dark Revelations"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session Twelve: *"Waterdeep Arrival and Dark Revelations."*

**[beat]** The portal snapped shut behind them, and Modred felt it immediately - something had been lost. Something had been taken. He rolled the die of fate and found himself surging with unexpected energy, twelve points of borrowed strength coursing through his veins. But when he looked down at his hands... the tips of his fingers had begun to turn black. He said nothing. He simply pulled on his gloves and followed the others through the forest.

**[pause]** Waterdeep rose before them like a fever dream of civilization - ten times the size of Neverwinter, overwhelming in its chaos of merchants, dogs, crowds, and endless noise. Raenar led them through the eastern gates, and slowly, the cacophony faded into background music.

**[warmer tone]** At Statue Protectors Square, the party encountered the city's colorful inhabitants. A gnome named Gigz demonstrated his experimental smoke device with childlike enthusiasm - "When magic doesn't work, then the device would still work!" - while the mage Savan dismissed such tinkering with scholarly disdain. Drox, the minotaur armorsmith, towered over them all, promising Modred new armor when he was ready. Milo listened to talk of susur trees and diamond dust, always gathering knowledge.

**[softer]** And Clover - Clover transformed into a cat and let herself be scooped up by a guard, purring contentedly while the others negotiated their way into places cats should not go.

**[darker shift]** But it was House De Moray that awaited Modred. The noble district's pristine streets led to a tall, imposing building draped in blue banners - two crossed swords, one aflame. The family heraldry. The family shame.

**[building emotion]** Inside, darkness. Windows covered, torches barely flickering. And there, sprawled across his throne like a man who had forgotten how to sit upright, was Godwin De Moray. Modred's father. Unkempt beard, unwashed flesh, empty bottles scattered at his feet. The throne beside him - his mother's throne - sat empty.

**[voice breaking slightly]** "I have no son," Godwin slurred. "My son is gone. Leave."

**[beat]** When Milo tried to introduce himself, the old man's grief transformed into rage. "I said, LEAVE!" A wall of fire erupted from nothing, flames licking the ceiling, twenty points of damage searing through the party. Clover was forced from her cat form. But Milo - Milo reached into the flow of time itself, bending the moment, and on the second attempt, dispelled the flames.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Godwin's laugh became a sob. The rage drained away, leaving only a broken man.

**[pause]** Guard Ulrik filled in the missing years. After Modred left, Godwin had poured everything into Arthur, the younger son. Together they'd investigated cult rumors, found cultists performing dark rituals in the forest. Arthur returned changed - aggressive, wrong. Then Arthur vanished entirely. Godwin searched desperately, found nothing. "He had lost both of his sons." And Modred's mother? She'd left the madness behind, joining the House of Justice as a priestess of Tyr.

**[shifting focus]** At the Sated Satyr Inn that evening, a different kind of reunion awaited. Percy - Modred's childhood friend - lounged among admirers, playing cards with casual confidence. "You used to be so fun," he told Modred. "You were at parties." Now Percy proposed a heist: rob a rumored necromancer in a northern tower. Clover was delighted - "I haven't done a heist before!" - while Jaspar dismissed Percy entirely: "I have learned to tolerate Modred because he actually seems to have some good human quality sometimes. But that guy, no."

**[warmer tone]** Clover spoke with Raenar's golden retriever Pogo through magic. "Oh my god, you understand me!" the dog exclaimed, thrilled to finally share his thoughts about treats, walks, and his hatred of cats.

**[adventure building]** As they discussed entering the upcoming masquerade - hosted by House Castellers, rivals to House De Moray - the party finally, after five levels of adventuring together, chose a name. "The The Icebreakers."

**[pause]** It felt right.

**[darker shift]** But in the deep hours of night, Modred woke with a feeling of wrongness. He checked his hands.

**[building intensity]** The corruption had spread. What had been fingertips was now halfway down every finger, pitch black, visible even in the darkness of his room.

**[explosive]** "Look at my fingers!" he cried, bursting into Milo's room. "They're all pitch black! Should I cut them off?"

**[hushed awe]** Milo's Identify found nothing. His Detect Magic sensed no aura. Clover's Lesser Restoration brought only a warm feeling that changed nothing. Jaspar glanced at the blackened hands, muttered "Sailor's hand fingers," and went back to sleep.

**[bringing together]** So Modred carried his own weight - the weight of family destroyed, of corruption spreading through his flesh. Clover stood with him, the only one willing to race through dark Waterdeep streets seeking temples and hope. Milo and Jaspar returned to their beds, their attempts exhausted.

**[final words, heavy]** The The Icebreakers had found their name. But in finding it, one of them was losing himself, piece by blackened piece.

**[pause]** The House of Justice waited somewhere in the darkness ahead.

**[whispered]** And the corruption... was not slowing down.
