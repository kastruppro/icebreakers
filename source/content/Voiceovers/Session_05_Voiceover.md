# Session 5 Voiceover: "Politics and Prophecy"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 5: *"Politics and Prophecy."*

**[beat]** Morning light filtered through the windows of the Thirsty Goat Tavern, carrying with it the promise of change. A new banner hung in the streets — two faces, two futures. Sebastian and Liset, vying for power in a city without its lord. As the party gathered over breakfast, Milo shared his discoveries from the night before, ancient words he could not read. Auren's voice carried the Celestial translation: *"Time holds no sway, there's no delay, there's only today."*
**[pause]** Words that would echo through everything that followed.

**[warmer tone]** The party scattered to the winds of their own curiosity. Jaspar made his way to Dependable Defenses, ordering sturdy armor from a gruff dwarf smith who spoke of opportunity — a frozen pirate ship locked in ice, waiting to be plundered. Milo sought wisdom at the House of Knowledge, where Irena greeted him with troubling news. The cult books — missing. Pages ripped from their bindings. Someone was erasing the past.
**[softer]** Only scraps remained of something called "The Chained" — a name, half a symbol, and shadows where answers should be.

**[building emotion]** At the marketplace, the candidates spoke. Liset first — her words painting a vision of power for the common folk, strange coming from one of noble blood. Auren sensed truth in her conviction, yet mystery clouded her purpose. Jaspar noticed her people scanning the crowd, searching for someone unseen. Modred moved closer, ready for trouble.
**[beat]** Then Sebastian took the stage, speaking of finding Lord Neverember, of magic for everyone. *"Lord Neverember wouldn't let me,"* he declared, *"but now I can."*

**[darker shift]** First — **[pause]** first, they scattered. Jaspar approached Sebastian with honeyed words about speechwriting, but Sebastian had other plans. At his residence, Sebastian revealed he had seen the portal through which Lord Neverember vanished — and seemed utterly unconcerned. His true interest was a fetch quest: the Erloom hammer, a powerful artifact lost at Axeholm. Stolen, according to a dwarf witness, by someone with *long ears and long hair.*
**[voice breaking slightly]** Someone who sounded very much like a harengon.

**[shifting focus]** Milo buried himself in dragon lore at the House of Knowledge. White dragons, he learned, were more clever than aggressive. People had survived speaking with them. They breathed ice and feared fire. They lived in mountain caves and sometimes kept servants — though Milo read between the lines and saw the word *slaves.*
**[pause]** And then Irena brought news that changed everything. Edward Hammel — the mysterious name from Milo's book — was buried in the cemetery. Dead for two hundred years.

**[adventure building]** Modred and Auren infiltrated the Moonstone Mask, working the crowd for information. When Liset arrived, bathing the room in wine and good cheer, Auren crafted a distraction. His voice rose in Celestial, a song of summer coming, and the room turned to listen in wonder. Even Modred nearly forgot himself before shaking free and approaching Liset.
**[beat]** She deflected questions about Lord Neverember with practiced grace. But when Auren revealed their scheme, she laughed — genuinely amused — and returned to Modred. How did she know Celestial? *"Languages are a hobby,"* she said with a smile that revealed nothing.
**[pause]** She offered Auren a job. Another thread in the web.

**[hushed awe]** At the cemetery, the administrator Svend confirmed the impossible: Edward Hammel died two centuries ago. Milo found a strange substance near the grave and carefully transferred it to his dagger. That night, the whole party returned under cover of darkness.
**[darker shift]** They dug. Shovel striking earth, earth giving way to wood, wood opening to reveal — nothing. No answers in that cold grave. They left without reburying it, another mystery added to their growing collection.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Sleep came to the Thirsty Goat. But for Jaspar, rest brought no peace. In his dreams, he prayed to Selune, then felt himself falling, landing on his feet amid burning people. The sky tore open, light pouring forth, and everything transformed to grass, then back to normal, like a miracle. Divine wings spread across the heavens.
**[whispered]** *"Jaspar my child,"* came a voice, *"soon we will conquer the world."*
**[beat]** The wings clamped shut. And everything became fire once more.

**[bringing together]** Each hero carried their own weight that night. Milo, piecing together ancient puzzles and dragon lore, suspecting his missing sister in every shadow. Jaspar, courting dangerous alliances while prophecy invaded his sleep. Modred, seeking answers in taverns and finding only more questions. Auren, his Celestial song turning heads while Liset revealed depths she kept carefully hidden.
**[final words, heavy]** Someone was erasing the past. Someone who looked like Milo had stolen a powerful artifact. A man dead two hundred years still cast shadows into the present.
**[pause]** And somewhere, in a realm between sleep and waking, divine wings promised conquest and fire.
**[whispered]** What god had marked Jaspar as their child? And when the world burned, whose hands would hold the match?
