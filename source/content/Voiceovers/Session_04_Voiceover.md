# Session 4 Voiceover: "Ghosts of the Crown"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session Four: *"Ghosts of the Crown."*

**[beat]** Deep beneath Neverwinter Castle, where ice clung to ancient stone and shadows stretched between forgotten graves, our heroes found themselves face to face with something beyond the mortal veil. A ghost, impaled by ice that should not exist, writhing in pain that transcended death itself. Jaspar showed it the sword he carried - that strange, cursed blade - and asked if it recognized the power within.

**[pause]** It did. And it was not alone.

**[darker shift]** Six more spirits emerged from the frozen darkness, rising from their graves to join the first. Seven guardians. Seven protectors of kings. They spoke as one voice, their words echoing through the chamber with the weight of centuries. They had each died at different times, across different generations, but they shared one purpose - protecting the rulers of Neverwinter. And they shared one fate - death at the hands of a cult wielding the very power Jaspar now carried.

**[building emotion]** "Bury the sword," they warned. "It might make one strong, but you also might go mad."

**[pause]** But they offered something else. A crown. Ancient and gleaming, infused with their spirits. If worn, they could aid the bearer - but at a cost. The crown would drain whoever wore it, siphoning their life force to fuel the ghosts' power.

**[beat]** Sir Modred stepped forward. Without hesitation, without fear, the knight accepted the burden. The ghosts circled the crown, their forms dissolving into its metal. When it flew from the altar, Modred's hand was there to catch it.

**[warmer tone]** They emerged from the depths, the injured guard supported between them, and collected their reward for finding Lord Neverember. But answers, it seemed, only bred more questions. At the House of Knowledge, crowds gathered beneath a politician's voice calling for new leadership. Elira Moonshadow found Milo among the chaos - a friend in uncertain times - but her warmth carried a warning. Professor Blackthorn had changed since the ice came. He was pushing for Sebastian to take power, and his eyes held secrets.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** In a private chamber, Master Gearwhistle examined the cursed sword with trembling hands. This gnome, who had been Milo's mentor, who had shaped so much of who the young wizard had become, looked at his former student with something like pity.

**[voice breaking slightly]** "Your parents should have told you about this," he said. "They've researched it for generations. The Swiftclocks... are probably bad people, Milo."

**[pause]** The words landed like stones.

**[shifting focus]** While the others talked with Blackthorn - who grew only more suspicious when denied a viewing of the sword, dismissing Milo as "not important" - Milo and Auren slipped away to the Swiftclock home. There they found his parents exactly as before: frozen in time, unreachable, unknowable. But the house held secrets they had not uncovered.

**[building intensity]** In the parents' bedroom, Milo's detect magic spell revealed what his eyes could not see. A ring in his mother's bed, pulsing with arcane energy. Something deeper within the closet, hidden behind ordinary clothes. Auren found it - a hanger that, when pulled, opened a door to a room that should not exist.

**[hushed awe]** Inside: a spellbook on a table. A locked drawer that Auren broke open with desperate strength, revealing a journal written in many hands across many generations. Research on the slime creature. On the cult that kept returning through the centuries. On the Luxon Beacon and the portals it could open - though the journal warned that such power might drive one to madness.

**[pause]** How long had the Swiftclocks known? How many of Milo's ancestors had written in that book, passing down secrets while the cult rose and fell and rose again?

**[bringing together]** They reunited at The Thirsty Goat, Brost the tavern keeper offering rooms while they shared their findings. Each hero carried their own weight that night. Modred, bearing a crown that held the souls of the dead. Jaspar, warned that his weapon might unmake him even as it granted power. Auren, witness to a family's dark inheritance. And Milo - poor Milo - learning that everything he thought he knew about his parents might have been a carefully constructed lie.

**[beat]** That night, as Milo studied the spellbook and learned to bend gravity and freeze objects in space, Jaspar dreamed. He fell through darkness, catching fire, burning and burning until he slammed into the ground of a world already aflame. When he woke, the heat still lingered on his skin.

**[final words, heavy]** The ghosts spoke of a cult camp north of Waterdeep, a month's journey away. The journal spoke of cycles - the cult vanishing for generations only to return. Blackthorn pushed for Sebastian's power. And somewhere in Milo's blood ran the same questions his family had asked for centuries.

**[whispered]** Who were the Swiftclocks, really? And what had they been preparing for all this time?
