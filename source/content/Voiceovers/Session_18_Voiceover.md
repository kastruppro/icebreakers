# Session 18 Voiceover: "The Masquerade Heist"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* — Session 18: *"The Masquerade Heist."*

**[beat]** The party remained scattered within the gilded walls of House Castellers. Music played on its own, enchanted instruments filling the masquerade with false merriment while dark secrets lurked behind locked doors. Clover, expelled from the ball for his earlier infiltration, paced in the shadows outside — but a closed door had never stopped a determined druid. Meanwhile, inside, Jaspar twirled across the dance floor, Modred stalked the edges of the crowd, and Milo's arcane senses reached through the walls, finding something deeply wrong.
**[pause]** The Castellers were hiding far more than wealth.

**[warmer tone]** In the ballroom, Jaspar charmed Isabel — a noble daughter whose family controlled Waterdeep's docks. Through pleasant conversation and the careful revelation of his angelic heritage, he gathered whispers: the Castellers' children hadn't been seen in months. Missing, some said. Dead, whispered others.
**[softer]** Isabel knew nothing concrete, only rumors — but her eyes spoke of a family that had risen too fast, with wealth that had appeared from nowhere.

**[darker shift]** Modred found the Daggers of the North watching from the margins — fellow arena champions from Daggerford. The elf leader pulled him aside, her voice low and urgent. They carried a vial of the black corruption, the same substance spreading through their weapons. A beast had attacked their hometown. One of their own had died. And they had come here because they sensed dangerous magic above.
**[beat]** "The Castellers are not to be trusted," she warned.

**[building emotion]** Outside, Clover shifted into a cat — sleek, silent, determined. He scaled the mansion wall and slipped through a cracked window on the first floor. Toys scattered across the room. Children's paintings adorned the walls. And there, floating between two small beds, was Thistle.
**[voice breaking slightly]** His sister. Alive. Suspended in a magical trance, glowing threads extending from her head to two sleeping children who writhed with nightmares. Her body was cold as ice — except her head, which burned warm.

**[gentle, sorrowful]** Clover pulled her down, but she floated back up, a balloon tethered to something unseen. He recognized the magic from stories whispered in the Feywild — consciousness manipulation, something feeding on dreams or channeling them elsewhere. But he couldn't break it. He couldn't wake her.
**[pause]** He could only witness what they had done to her.

**[adventure building]** When guards discovered him, Clover fled through a door he'd bashed open with a shillelagh-enchanted hobby horse. He leaped from the roof — and fell short.
**[beat]** But Milo was watching through Tock. With a surge of chronomancy, he cast Vortex Warp and yanked Clover mid-fall directly into a second-floor study where Modred waited.
**[building intensity]** Together, they forced open a desk drawer and found treasure: a diamond, two hundred gold, and a heavy grimoire bound in red and gold. The Book of Vile Darkness.

**[explosive]** Then they opened the wrong door.

Animated armor crashed forward, blade swinging. Modred's slashing strikes bounced off its plating. Clover's magical bludgeoning found purchase, but the construct was relentless. Tock threw a coat over its head and cast Immovable Object, pinning it in place — but only for a moment. Modred took hit after hit, Shield spell flickering, blood running down his armor.
**[pause]** They couldn't win. They fled through the window.

**[darker shift]** Inside, Jaspar made a choice. He cast Daylight in the center of the ballroom — a blinding sun that seared through masks and sent nobles screaming. In the chaos, Milo sprinted upstairs to the children's room. He cast Dispel Magic on Thistle.
**[beat]** Nothing happened.
**[pause]** The magic didn't recognize her condition. It couldn't be broken.

**[hushed awe]** Milo escaped with Vortex Warp to the garden. Clover hid in a bush for an hour, stealth check 19, guards passing within feet of his hiding spot. When he'd recovered his Wild Shape, he became a spider — climbed to the weapon check, grabbed his staff, and carried the stolen spellbook to freedom.

**[bringing together]** The The Icebreakers reunited at the Sated Satyr Inn. Modred sat at the bar, drinking heavily, his armor still wet with his own blood. "Another day like this," he muttered, "and I'm gonna die very young."
**[softer]** Milo slid onto the stool beside him. "Better young than old and bald."

**[final words, heavy]** Each of them carried something from that house. Jaspar carried intelligence and a noblewoman's heart. Modred carried wounds and the Daggers' warning. Milo carried the Book of Vile Darkness, its necromantic spells waiting to be studied. And Clover carried the weight of leaving his sister behind — alive but trapped, a puppet of unknown magic.
**[pause]** Thistle remained floating in that room, bound to nightmare children, serving purposes the party could only guess.
**[whispered]** Tomorrow, the Daggers of the North would share what they knew. But tonight, the Icebreakers sat with stolen treasure and broken hopes — and the knowledge that the Castellers' secrets ran deeper than any of them had imagined.
