# Session 6 Voiceover: "Pirates and Dragons"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session 6: *"Pirates and Dragons."*

**[beat]** Rain fell on Neverwinter that morning. The kind of rain that turns to ice before it hits the ground. In the Thirsty Goat tavern, Brost set down plates of hot food and asked about the election - that day, Neverwinter would choose its new leader. But our heroes had other plans.

**[pause]** There was treasure to be found. And a pirate ship waiting in the frozen harbor.

**[adventure building]** Seventy feet from the docks, a ship hung suspended in ice - a massive spike of frost piercing it from below like a frozen spear thrust from the depths. Pirates stood motionless on the deck, caught mid-stride, mid-breath, frozen in time. And somewhere aboard, there was gold.

**[beat]** Auren moved first. A shimmer of magic, a whispered word, and he vanished - reappearing in the air beside the anchor chain dangling above the harbor. He caught it, climbed, and lowered it for the others. One by one, they ascended into that tomb of ice and wood.

**[warmer tone]** What they found told a story cut short. A chest on deck held gold and a pirate's hat - which Milo claimed with the delight of a scholar who'd always wanted to look roguish. Below deck, Tock the mechanical spider skittered ahead while his master followed into the darkness. There, in the captain's quarters, they found something more valuable than gold.

**[pause]** A map. Islands marked with X's, save for one - one island left unmarked, as if the captain himself didn't know what lay there. Milo traced his finger over that blank space and marked it with an O. Something to remember. Something to find, someday.

**[darker shift]** Jaspar, ever thoughtful, paused before leaving. The frozen pirates might thaw one day - and if they did, they'd drown. So he strapped flotation devices to their rigid forms. A kindness for men who might never wake. Modred, meanwhile, broke into a cabinet with the pommel of his dagger, sending expensive rum cascading across the floor but revealing a second moonstone hidden within.

**[beat]** They descended by anchor and returned to shore richer than they'd come. Two rum bottles went to Brost as thanks - which he promptly began sampling with enthusiasm. The rest they kept, along with the moonstones and the map and the hat.

**[building tension]** At Dependable Defenses, they sold a moonstone for a hundred and ninety gold pieces. Modred had to mention the guards, and the shopkeeper's potential connections to piracy, before the price reached acceptable levels. Then to the stables at the south gate, where rain had turned to hail, and Aron sold them a draft horse and carriage for the journey ahead.

**[pause]** Axeholm awaited. The ancient dwarven stronghold where answers might be found. But the road had other ideas.

**[building intensity]** They saw it from the carriage - a ring of frost expanding from the mountain like a shockwave, massive and unstoppable. And ahead of it, fleeing, a shape that made their blood run cold. The white dragon, wings beating desperately as it tried to outrun the freeze. It looped, dove beneath the expanding ring, and turned back toward the mountain - but the wave kept coming.

**[explosive]** Ice spikes erupted from the road. The carriage shattered. The horse screamed and fled into the hills. And our heroes stood in the wreckage, watching the frost wave pass overhead, understanding for the first time that even dragons feared what was happening here.

**[pause]** They walked the rest of the way.

**[darker shift]** What they found at Axeholm's gates was worse than the journey. Dwarves stood frozen around the entrance, their final moments preserved in ice - warriors caught defending their home against something they couldn't fight. And there, perched above the gate like a gargoyle of scale and spite, sat the white dragon itself. Eating a goat. Not noticing them. Yet.

**[building tension]** Auren didn't hesitate. He ran - faster than thought, faster than sight - and vanished through the gate before the dragon could blink. Modred followed, weaving between frozen dwarves, his boots silent on the snow. Then Jaspar moved - the rogue, the stealthy one, the professional - and his foot struck ice with a crack that echoed across the mountainside.

**[beat]** The dragon's head snapped up. Its eyes found Jaspar. Its breath came cold.

**[pause]** He made it. Barely. The dragon's strike grazed him as he dove through the gate, ice crystallizing on his armor. Milo, who'd started running the moment Jaspar stumbled, slipped through in the chaos - unseen, unnoticed, his luck holding where the rogue's had failed.

**[softer]** They closed the gate together. Iron rang against iron. And in the darkness of Axeholm's entrance hall, they caught their breath.

**[bringing together]** Each hero carried their own weight that day. Milo, with a new hat and a map to unknown places. Jaspar, who remembered to save the frozen before saving himself. Modred, whose intimidation opened doors and wallets alike. And Auren, whose speed left even dragons blinking at empty air.

**[final words, heavy]** Outside, a dragon prowled and freeze waves rolled down from the mountains. Inside, dwarves waited in ice and darkness held secrets.

**[whispered]** What could freeze even a dragon's world? And what awaited them in the halls of Axeholm?
