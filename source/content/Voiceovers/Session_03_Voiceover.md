# Session 3 Voiceover: "Neverwinter Lockdown"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session 3: *"Neverwinter Lockdown."*

**[beat]** The sun dipped below the horizon as our heroes reached the gates of Neverwinter - a city Milo once called home. But this was not the Neverwinter of warm memories and bustling markets. The guards spoke in hushed, urgent tones. The city was dangerous at night now. Lucas, a weary soldier, led them through streets transformed into a gallery of frozen souls - citizens caught mid-stride, mid-conversation, mid-life - all encased in crystalline prisons of ice. Past the graveyard they walked. Past the House of Knowledge. Past a church with prayers left unanswered. The dragon had come yesterday. And it had left winter in its wake.

**[warmer tone]** Rising above the frozen city, glowing silver in the moonlight, floated the Moonstone Mask - an inn suspended impossibly in the air. Inside, masked waiters glided between tables, and the proprietor Liset greeted them with a clap and an overwhelming cloud of floral perfume. But it was another figure who caught their attention - a silver-haired rogue in black leather, dark eyes gleaming with mischief, selling what he claimed was a potion to unfreeze the city's victims.

**[beat]** Milo saw through the deception instantly. The potion held no magic. Yet there was something about this stranger - Jaspar Starshade - that hinted at depths beneath the con.

**[softer]** Later, at the harbor, Jaspar revealed his truth. He did not steal for greed. He stole from the wealthy who had turned their backs on the children of Neverwinter's streets - children like he once was. Every coin he took went to feed orphans, to give them what the city's nobles would not.

**[darker shift]** But something else stirred at that harbor. Alien slime smeared across the walls, pulsing with unnatural life. When Jaspar drew his blade, the substance *reached* for it - crawled up the steel in hues of purple and crimson, as if drawn to something within the weapon itself.

**[pause]** A mystery for another time.

**[adventure building]** The quest board offered three paths: investigate the frozen at Cloak Tower, hunt the dragon, or find Lord Neverember - the ruler of Neverwinter, gone missing in his own castle. The choice was made. A search party assembled, and our heroes marched toward Neverwinter Castle.

**[building intensity]** But the castle was not as they remembered. Ice spikes had thrust the entire structure skyward, shattering the bridges that once connected it to the city. The only entrance lay beneath - a treacherous climb down frozen pillars. Modred struggled against the slick surface. Jaspar's fingers slipped and scraped. But Auren scaled it with ease, pulling himself into the darkness above.

**[pause]** Inside, the screams began. Somewhere below, something suffered.

They found a ballroom first - nobles frozen in eternal waltz, glasses raised to toasts they would never complete. Then upward, through grand doors, into the throne room.

**[darker shift]** Lord Neverember sat upon his throne, encased in ice from the waist down, his chest and head still free, still breathing shallow, desperate breaths. Beside him, a soldier - his Loyal Guard - stood frozen with one arm embedded in the wall.

**[explosive]** Ice skeletons erupted from the frost. Blades clashed. The undead pressed toward the helpless lord, and in one terrible, impossible moment, the Loyal Guard *moved*. He tore his sword through his own arm - severing the limb that bound him - and threw himself between his lord and death. He collapsed in a spreading pool of crimson, but Jaspar was there, hands glowing with healing light, pulling the man back from the void.

**[building intensity]** The skeletons fell - but their bones refused to rest. They gathered, fused, rose again as a single towering giant of rattling death. Every blow it struck cracked the ancient floor. The party fought with everything they had. Spells flew. Steel sang.

**[pause]** And then the giant fell.

**[hushed awe]** Its collapse was catastrophic. Stone gave way. The floor shattered. And Lord Neverember - still bound to his throne of ice - plummeted through the breach. Auren watched, helpless, as the lord fell into empty air - and then a portal, triangular and humming with dark energy, opened from nothing and *swallowed* him whole.

**[beat]** Gone. Their ruler, their mission - simply... gone.

**[mysterious tone]** In the basement they found their answers - and more questions. Nine portraits lined the walls. Nine tombs bore the inscription: *"Here lie the Guardians of Nine."* And in the center, trapped within the ice itself, a ghost writhed and screamed.

**[voice breaking slightly]** *"Help,"* it cried. *"It hurts."*

**[bringing together]** Each hero carried something from that night. Milo, the knowledge that his home city stood frozen and dying. Jaspar, the weight of secrets bound to his blade. Modred, the memory of ice and failure on that treacherous climb. Auren, the image of a lord vanishing into impossible darkness.

**[final words, heavy]** The ice dragon's shadow loomed over Neverwinter. A ruler had vanished into the void. And somewhere beneath the castle, the dead could not rest.

**[whispered]** Who were the Guardians of Nine? What opened that portal? And what darkness had they only begun to uncover?
