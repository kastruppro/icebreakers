# Session 13 Voiceover: "Divine Quests and Arena Glory"

**[soft, intimate tone]** Last time, in the *Adventures of Icespire Peak* - Session Thirteen: *"Divine Quests and Arena Glory."*

**[beat]** The House of Justice rose before Modred and Clover like a promise of answers. Inside, an old priest took one look at Modred's blackened hands and sighed - the corruption had spread overnight, from fingertips to halfway up his fingers. But this time, there was knowledge to be gained. Many others had been afflicted. All connected to the cult of Tharizdun. And while no cure existed, Swift Flower could slow the rot. Months, not days.

**[pause]** Small mercy. But mercy nonetheless.

**[warmer tone]** Then Morgane appeared - Modred's mother, now a priestess of Tyr, cloaked in devotion where once she'd worn noble finery. She had known he was coming. Tyr had whispered it to her in prayer. "Arthur possessed, your father mad," she told him, her voice heavy with years of grief. "Both my sons leaving broke him completely."

**[beat]** But the reunion was interrupted by something greater.

**[darker shift]** Modred and Clover found themselves pulled through Tyr's hollow stone eyes into a realm of absolute darkness. A black dog padded before them, leading them to an armory where Tyr's presence manifested in a statue's gaze. The God of Justice spoke directly: his gauntlets had been stolen, hidden in cult ruins in the forest. They would be weapons against the Betrayer God.

**[pause]** "I cannot interfere directly," Tyr's voice resonated. "Divine rules. But you can."

**[building emotion]** So the party split. Modred and Clover ventured into the forest, where Clover's druid knowledge found Swift Flower immediately. And deeper in the trees, they found something else - a cultist in red robes, who after having his legs wounded and his life threatened, revealed the cult's darkest secret.

**[voice breaking slightly]** Pilgrims. They were taking pilgrims from the road. Sacrificing them to Tharizdun in ruins hidden among the trees.

**[shifting focus]** Meanwhile, Milo and Jaspar walked the merchant streets of Waterdeep. At Sevarna's Magic Shop, Milo acquired sending stones and a black mask with horns - red-eyed, sinister, capable of casting Wither and Bloom three times daily. At Gigz Gears, Jaspar commissioned a peculiar device: a ball bearing spreader with a small door for a Light cantrip. At the Temple of Tymora, Jaspar knelt in prayer while Milo spoke with priests.

**[softer]** Different paths. Different purposes. But all roads led back together.

**[adventure building]** The captured cultist was delivered to Morgane for imprisonment. Jaspar emerged from The Peppermint Minotaur in gleaming splint armor, two hundred gold lighter but significantly harder to kill. And then - the Field of Triumph.

**[pause]** The arena awaited.

**[building intensity]** They registered as "The The Icebreakers." Four against four. Non-lethal combat. The prize: tickets to House Castellers' masquerade ball.

**[beat]** The gates opened, and Jaspar threw his device.

**[explosive]** Ball bearings scattered across the sand - glowing in multiple colors from the Light spell within. A moment of stunned silence from the crowd. Then roaring approval that shook the walls.

**[hushed awe]** "Oh, they seem to be a dramatic group!" the announcer cried. "We haven't had that in a while!"

**[building intensity]** And up in the pavilion, watching with cold eyes... Victor Castellers took his seat.

**[adventure building]** The combat was chaos and glory. Stone pillars erupted thirty feet from the arena floor. Milo cast Bless, then Tasha's Hideous Laughter that left the enemy Sorcerer helpless. Clover shifted from Dire Wolf to Giant Spider, laid Spike Growth across the field - then critically failed a Web spell that engulfed herself and Milo both in sticky strands.

**[beat]** But Jaspar - Jaspar was magnificent.

**[explosive]** A somersault, a crossbow bolt, a natural twenty on performance followed by a critical hit. The crowd screamed his name. And when a Barbarian's axe finally struck him, light burst from Jaspar's chest - brilliant, blinding, sending his attacker reeling.

**[softer]** The Aasimar's nature, revealed at last.

**[building intensity]** Modred fought from atop a pillar, his bonded dagger flying again and again, Action Surge pushing him beyond normal limits. The enemy Warlock fell thirty feet when Modred's throws knocked her from her perch.

**[pause]** One by one, their opponents yielded.

**[bringing together]** And when it was done, Jaspar knelt beside the fallen Barbarian and healed him. Sportsmanship in victory.

**[beat]** Victor Castellers watched from above. He did not clap.

**[warmer tone]** Four tickets to the masquerade. Two days until the ball. The party had earned their entry - not through gold or social standing, but through blood and spectacle.

**[final words, heavy]** Modred carried the weight of divine mandate - Tyr's gauntlets waiting in cult-infested ruins. Clover carried Swift Flower and desperate hope for Thistle. Milo carried dark artifacts and darker knowledge about the sacrifices on Pilgrim's Road. And Jaspar carried light inside him that even he didn't fully understand.

**[pause]** They were the The Icebreakers now. Named and proven.

**[darker shift]** But House Castellers waited. Victor's cold gaze had marked them.

**[whispered]** And somewhere in the forest ruins, Tyr's gauntlets lay in chains... guarded by those who served the Betrayer God.
