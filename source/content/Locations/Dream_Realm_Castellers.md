# Dream Realm - Castellers

## Quick Reference
**Region:** [[Dream Realm]]
**Type:** Pocket Dimension/Elemental Arena
**Status:** Destroyed - Collapsed when dream-beast was slain

## Description
A pocket dimension beneath House Castellers where [[Thistle]] was held captive under [[Tharizdun]]'s spell. The realm manifested as a burning square room that dynamically transformed based on elemental damage dealt within it. The room served as an arena for combat against an elemental chimera-beast that guarded Thistle's imprisonment.

The realm had a unique property: voices from the waking world could echo through as warnings, allowing [[Ammalia Castellers]] and the [[Daggers of the North]] to communicate with the party during combat.

## Notable Areas

### The Arena Chamber
- Square room that transformed with elemental energy
- Initially burning with fire, dealing passive fire damage to those inside
- Walls covered in stone armor matching the beast's adaptation
- Split into half-fire/half-ice zones after cold damage was introduced
- Collapsed entirely when the dream-beast was slain

## NPCs Found Here
- [[Thistle]] - Held captive under Tharizdun's spell, freed when beast was slain
- Elemental Chimera-Beast - Guardian creature with adaptive elemental armor (destroyed)

## Enemies Encountered

### Elemental Chimera-Beast
- Body covered in stone armor, wreathed in flames
- Three heads: main mouth and two tails, all capable of fire breath
- **Special Ability:** Adapts to damage types - grows armor matching whatever damages it
- Room transforms to match the beast's current element
- Vulnerable to forcing elemental shifts (cold damage broke fire form)
- When slain, its death scream transformed into [[Thistle]]'s voice

## Events at This Location
- Session 20: Party entered dream realm to rescue Thistle, began combat with elemental beast
- Session 21:
  - [[Clover]] opened with critical hit in wolf form
  - [[Jaspar Starshade]] investigated beast, learned about its adaptive armor ability
  - [[Clover]] cast Elemental Weapon (Cold) on [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]]'s sword - turning point of battle
  - Beast transformed to half-fire/half-ice, becoming vulnerable
  - [[Milo Swiftclock]] delivered killing blow with Fireball
  - Realm collapsed, party woke in Castellers bedroom with freed Thistle

## Items Found Here
- None - pocket dimension contained only the beast and Thistle

## Combat Tactics Discovered
- Beast adapts to damage types, morphing to resist them
- Room transforms to match beast's element (fire room = fire beast)
- Forcing elemental change (cold damage against fire form) creates vulnerability
- Physical damage showed effect after elemental shift ("cracks forming")
- [[Modred_De_Moray|Sir Modred De Moray]]'s gauntlets overcome damage resistances
