# The Void

## Quick Reference
**Region:** Between Planes (between mortal realm and elsewhere)
**Type:** Extraplanar Space
**Status:** Active, dangerous

## Description
A place of pure blackness accessed through triangular portals. The void separates travelers from each other and shows them personalized visions of their deepest fears and desires. False divine beings appear through portals similar to the entrance, attempting to lure travelers to "come with" them. The experiences feel utterly real and are emotionally devastating.

Those who enter feel the worst despair, loss, and nothingness before their personalized visions begin.

## Notable Areas

### Individual Vision Spaces
- Each traveler is separated and experiences their own nightmare
- The void creates personalized rooms/environments from the traveler's memories and fears
- False divine beings (beautiful winged figures) appear to offer help and salvation

### Tharizdun's Realm
- Auren saw beyond the false divine to witness Tharizdun directly
- A massive demon hanging in 8 chains
- The mere sight burns the eyes
- Located deeper in the void, seen when the deception fails

## NPCs Found Here
- False Divine Beings - Beautiful winged figures that attempt to deceive travelers
- [[Tharizdun]] - The Chained One, visible when deceptions fail (glimpsed by Auren)

## Events at This Location
- Session 7: Party entered through ritual portal. Each member experienced personalized nightmare visions:
  - Auren: Saw forest burning, Thistle's face melting, rejected false divine, witnessed Tharizdun in chains
  - Milo: Saw family frozen in ice, questioned false celestial until it flickered, fled in terror
  - Jaspar: Saw mother and himself as baby, learned he is Aasimar, asked for time to think

## Secrets/Hidden Areas
- The false divine beings may be agents or aspects of Tharizdun
- The visions may contain truth mixed with lies (Jaspar's Aasimar revelation)
- The void may be connected to how Tharizdun communicates with the mortal world
