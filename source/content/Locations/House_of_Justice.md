# House of Justice (Temple of Tyr)

## Quick Reference
**Region:** [[Waterdeep]]
**Type:** Temple (Tyr)
**Status:** Active

## Description
The House of Justice is a grand temple dedicated to Tyr, the god of justice, located within Waterdeep. The imposing structure reflects Tyr's domains of law, order, and righteous judgment. The temple serves both as a place of worship and as a facility for holding and judging those accused of crimes. Its austere interior features imagery of scales, swords, and blindfolded figures representing impartial justice. This temple holds special significance for Modred, as his mother Morgane serves here as a priestess.

The temple features a massive statue of Tyr as its centerpiece. The doors remain open to visitors even during late evening hours. Quiet corners with blankets are designated for prayer and rest, and private rooms are available for discussions.
