- **Session 12:** Party stayed here after leaving House De Moray. Met Percy. Clover spoke with Pogo. Party officially named themselves "The The Icebreakers." Modred discovered corruption spreading at night.
- **Session 22:** Milo brought Ammalia here after escaping House Castellers. The entire tavern noticed their entrance - music stopped, patrons looked with mixed disgust and excitement at the notorious noblewoman. Milo found Raenar in a corner with Pogo. Raenar awkwardly flirted with Ammalia upon meeting her. Milo checked the party's rented rooms and examined the mysterious shrine/chest from House Castellers. Jaspar chose to sleep here rather than the temple for the comfortable bed.
