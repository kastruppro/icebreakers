# Field of Triumph

## Quick Reference
**Type:** Gladiatorial Arena
**Region:** [[Waterdeep]]
**Status:** Active

## Description
Waterdeep's premier gladiatorial arena where combatants fight for glory and prizes. Features gates for combatant entrance, stone pillars that can rise up to 30 feet during matches, and upper pavilion seating for nobles.

## Features
- Large arena floor with rising stone pillars
- Gates for dramatic combatant entrances
- Noble pavilion with elevated seating
- Non-lethal combat rules (typically)
- Prize: Masquerade ball tickets

## Funding
[[House_Castellers]] funds the Field of Triumph along with many other city projects - part of their suspicious rapid rise to power.

## History with Party
- **Session 12**: Party learned about the arena and the masquerade ticket prize.
- **Session 13**: The Icebreakers fought and won their arena match in dramatic fashion. [[Victor_Castellers|Victor Castellers]] watched from the pavilion but notably did not applaud their victory. Modred declared "House De Moray is back!" to thunderous applause.

## The Icebreakers' Victory
The party registered as "The Icebreakers" (finally choosing a team name at level 5). They won their 4v4 non-lethal combat match, earning tickets to the Castellers Masquerade.
