# Mountain Top

## Quick Reference
**Region:** Sword Mountains, overlooking [[Neverwinter]] forest
**Type:** Mountain Peak/Wilderness
**Status:** Active - site of major plot events

## Description
A snow-covered mountain peak overlooking the Neverwinter forest. This is where the stolen healing hammer was brought and where it became embedded in the mountain floor, causing the ice waves that plagued the land. The location is exposed to the elements and dragon attack.

## Notable Areas

### Hammer Site
- The healing hammer is embedded in the mountain floor
- Each pulse from the hammer creates waves of ice radiating outward
- Liora and Cora were frozen here mid-struggle over the hammer
- They briefly return to life between pulses before being refrozen
