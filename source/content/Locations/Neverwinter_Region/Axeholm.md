# Axeholm

## Quick Reference
**Region:** Mountains between Neverwinter and Phandalin
**Type:** Dwarven Stronghold/Dungeon
**Status:** Partially frozen, dragon-guarded entrance

## Description
An ancient dwarven stronghold built into the mountains. The entrance is flanked by dwarves frozen in ice, victims of the freeze waves emanating from somewhere within or above the fortress. A white dragon has claimed the entrance as its perch, making approach treacherous.

## Notable Areas

### Entrance Gate
- Massive dwarven gate
- Dwarves frozen in ice around it
- White dragon perches above, eating goats
- Successfully entered by sneaking past the dragon in Session 6

### Entrance Hall
- Dark interior
- Splits into multiple paths: two stairs leading upward, a corridor blocked by ice going forward, and two smaller passages going backward
- Snow/ice seeping through walls via triangular markings (discovered later)

## NPCs Found Here
- [[White_Dragon|White Dragon]] - Guards the entrance, eating goats
- [[Braum]] - Last unfrozen dwarf (met Session 7)
- Frozen dwarves - Throughout the fortress

## Items Found Here
- Stolen Hammer (heirloom with healing crystal) - Later discovered to be the source of freeze waves

## Events at This Location
