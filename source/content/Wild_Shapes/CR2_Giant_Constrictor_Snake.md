## Ability Scores

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Skills:** Perception +2
**Senses:** Blindsight 10 ft., passive Perception 12

## Actions

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage.

**Constrict.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the snake can't constrict another target.

## Use Case

Control and lockdown. Constrict restrains a target (DC 16 escape), 10 ft. reach on bite, huge HP pool (60), swim speed, and blindsight. Excellent for holding priority targets in place.
