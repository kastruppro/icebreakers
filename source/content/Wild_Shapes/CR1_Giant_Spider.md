## Ability Scores

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 11 (+0) | 4 (-3) |

**Skills:** Stealth +7
**Senses:** Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10

## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage, plus 9 (2d8) poison damage on failed DC 11 Constitution save. If poison reduces target to 0 HP, target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1 hour.

**Web (Recharge 5-6).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* Target is restrained by webbing. Escape requires DC 12 Strength check or destroying web (AC 10, 5 HP, vulnerable to fire, immune to bludgeoning/poison/psychic).

## Use Case

Control and ambush. Web restrains enemies at range, bite deals heavy poison damage, Spider Climb for 3D mobility, +7 Stealth for ambush. Blindsight 10 ft. detects invisible creatures.
