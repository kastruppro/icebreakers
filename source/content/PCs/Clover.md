## **Backstory**
Clover was born in the Feywild, where her family served as protectors of the Moonlit Pool, a sacred druidic site of great power. She trained as a Moon Druid under her parents' guidance, learning to draw upon the primal magic of the pool and master the art of wild shaping.

Her peaceful existence shattered when cultists of Tharizdun attacked the Moonlit Pool. In the chaos, her younger sister Thistle was kidnapped, her parents were killed, and the sacred site was destroyed. The cultists stole an artifact from the pool - though Thistle never learned what it was - and scattered the druidic community.

Desperate to find her sister and avenge her family, Clover wandered through a portal from the Feywild and found herself in Neverwinter, on the Material Plane. There, during a battle against a shadow entity possessing Arthur De Moray in the Chapel of Oghma, she encountered the Neverwinter Icebreakers and joined their cause.

Her journey with the party has been driven by the singular goal of rescuing Thistle, a mission that finally succeeded in Session 21 when the party entered Thistle's nightmare using the Dream Staff and defeated the elemental chimera-beast holding her captive.

## **Current Knowledge**
* Clover is now the **Protector of the Moonlit Pool** - a title inherited from her fallen family
* She has promised to teach Thistle "the ways" of their druidic tradition
* The cultists who attacked the Moonlit Pool were seeking "Thassa" and "strong spellcasters that could bind someone"
* An unknown artifact was stolen from the Moonlit Pool during the attack

## Familiar / Wild Shapes

### Notable Wild Shape Forms
Clover has demonstrated mastery over numerous wild shape forms throughout her adventures:

**Combat Forms:**
- **Giant Constrictor Snake** (gained at Level 6)
- **Dire Wolf** - used in arena combat
- **Giant Spider** - used for stealth, climbing, and web attacks
- **Wolf** - used in the dream realm battle against Thistle's captor
- **Bear** - used during chase sequences

**Utility Forms:**
- **Spider** - tiny form used for infiltration (was thrown through the Substance barrier to retrieve Tyr's Gauntlets)
- **Warhorse** - used to carry multiple party members, including the escape from House Castellers
- **Giant Ape** - used for strength-based tasks like rescuing Raenar Neverember
- **Dog** - sometimes sleeps outdoors in animal form

## **Family**

**Parents** (deceased): Druids who protected the Moonlit Pool in the Feywild. Both were killed during the cultist attack on the sacred site. Clover saw them on a boat sailing through the underworld during the party's voyage through the Void - they did not respond when she saw them, confirming they had passed to the afterlife.

**[[Thistle]]** *(younger sister, approximately 16 years old - Harengon)*: A druid trainee who was kidnapped by cultists and placed under Tharizdun's direct spell. She was held at House Castellers, floating in a magical trance and connected to the sleeping Castellers children. After the party used the Dream Staff to enter her nightmare and defeat the beast within, Thistle was finally freed. She is now safe at the Temple of Tyr in Waterdeep, recovering from her ordeal and processing the loss of their parents. Clover has promised to teach her the role of Protector.

## **Friends and Allies**

**[[Thistle]]** *(Harengon Druid Trainee)*: See Family section above.

**[[Desna]]** *(Goddess of Dreams, Nightmares, Stars, and Luck)*: The goddess who provided the means to save Thistle. When the party visited her temple in Daggerford, Desna appeared in the form of a constellation face with starry cloud hair. She revealed that Thistle was under Tharizdun's direct spell - something no mortal magic could break. She entrusted Clover with the Dream Staff, the only hope to enter Thistle's nightmare and free her. Clover was willing to pay any price, and Desna provided the solution.

**[[Tyr]]** *(God of Justice)*: Clover received a divine vision from Tyr alongside Modred at the House of Justice in Waterdeep. Tyr tasked them with retrieving his stolen gauntlets from cult ruins, which Clover successfully claimed. The gauntlets are essential for destroying Tharizdun's chains at the four ruins around Waterdeep.

**[[Morgane]]** *(Human Priestess of Tyr)*: Modred's mother, who serves at the Temple of Tyr in Waterdeep. She examined Thistle after her rescue and confirmed she had no corruption or magical damage from her captivity. Morgane now helps care for Thistle at the temple.

## **Divine Items**

### [[Dream Staff]]
*Obtained from Desna in Session 19*

A beautiful glass staff that emanates warmth and starlight. Blessed by the goddess Desna herself.

**Properties:**
- **Dream Walking:** Allows the user to enter the dreams or nightmares of others
- **Sleep Aura:** Can put creatures to sleep (Wisdom save DC 16)
- **Weapon:** Can be used as a melee weapon

**Critical Warning:** If the user fails while inside someone's dream, they are trapped forever with the dreamer. There is no escape.

The staff was essential in freeing Thistle from Tharizdun's spell. When Clover accepted it, she said: *"Whatever the price is, I'm willing to pay it."*

### [[Tyr's Gauntlets]]
*Obtained from Temple of Tharizdun in Session 16*

Divine gauntlets from Tyr's own armory. They magically resized to fit Clover's small harengon hands when she claimed them.

**Properties:**
- **Chain Breaker:** Can interact with and destroy Tharizdun's chains at cult ruins
- **Divine Weapon:** A crucial weapon in the fight against the Betrayer God
- **Self-Adjusting:** Resizes to fit any wearer

**Party-Wide Boon:** When Clover retrieved the gauntlets, her exceptional persuasion convinced Tyr to grant all party members a special blessing:
> *"As an action, you can sacrifice some or all of your hit points to give to another creature, but you take on all recent injuries and conditions from that creature, including diseases, dismemberment, and death. You instantly die if doing this would bring you to 0 hit points."*

## **The Prophecy**

Before the party departed Neverwinter for Waterdeep, Liora Swiftclock delivered a prophecy directly to Clover, her eyes turning black as she spoke:

> *"A time will come when you have to choose between family and power. If you're not ready, it will be the end of the world."*

This prophecy was reinforced during Clover's trial in the Void, where a blindingly beautiful divine entity appeared at a blood-red version of the Moonlit Pool, offering immense power:

> *"I can give you power. I can give you immense power to find your family, to restore the moonlit pool, and to free your people."*

Clover refused, speaking words that defined her character: **"Light is not good in itself, only when balanced with dark."**

The entity then showed her the Chained One's true form with 8 chains - a vision of Tharizdun himself.

## **Key Moments**

### Joining the Icebreakers (Session 10)
Clover appeared during the battle against the shadow entity in the Chapel of Oghma, wild-shaping into a giant spider and joining the fight. She revealed her background as a protector of the Moonlit Pool whose family was gone and sister was missing.

### The Void Trial (Session 11)
While traveling through the Void to Waterdeep, Clover faced a divine temptation. She landed at a corrupted version of the Moonlit Pool and was offered power to save her family. She refused, and later saw her parents among the dead souls on a boat in the underworld - confirmation that they had died.

### Receiving Tyr's Gauntlets (Session 16)
In the Temple of Tharizdun, Clover transformed into a tiny spider and was thrown by Jaspar through the Substance barrier protecting Tyr's Gauntlets. She claimed them, and they shrank to fit her small harengon hands. Her persuasion with Tyr earned the divine boon for the entire party.

### Receiving the Dream Staff (Session 19)
At the Temple of Desna in Daggerford, the goddess revealed that Thistle was under Tharizdun's direct spell. Clover accepted the Dream Staff and its terrible risk - if she failed in the dream, she would be trapped forever.

### Rescuing Thistle (Session 21)
Using the Dream Staff, the party entered Thistle's nightmare. Clover's Elemental Weapon spell (cold damage on Modred's sword) proved to be the turning point in defeating the elemental chimera-beast. When the beast died, its scream transformed into Thistle's voice as she materialized and was freed.

### Reunion and Grief (Session 22)
At the Temple of Tyr, Clover finally reunited with Thistle and shared the devastating news about their parents' deaths. She accepted her new responsibility as Protector of the Moonlit Pool and promised to teach Thistle their ways.
