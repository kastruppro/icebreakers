## **Backstory**
Milo Swiftclock was born in the bustling streets of Neverwinter’s Protector’s Enclave. His father, **Ren Swiftclock**, operates the city's most prestigious horology workshop, catering to nobles, guildmasters, and officials, while his mother, **Serina**, manages the storefront with welcoming professionalism.

From the moment he could wind a mainspring, Milo was enthralled by the tick‑tock precision of clocks—and by the invisible force they measured. Endless evenings were spent in the workshop attic, diagramming gear ratios and sketching spell‑circles side‑by‑side.

During one of those attic rambles, Milo uncovered a false panel in an heirloom chest that belonged to Serina. Inside lay a palm‑sized sliver of crystalline amber that thrummed with faint, rhythmic pulses: a **Luxon beacon fragment**. Startled but spellbound, Milo kept the shard secret, suspecting it was a relic from his mother’s adventuring days—stories she never quite finished telling.

Months later he could no longer contain his curiosity. He brought the fragment to his mentor, **Master Tiberius Gearwhistle**, hoping the gnome’s genius would help him stabilise and study it. Gearwhistle’s reaction was swift and furious: the Luxon’s power was too volatile, the source too dubious. He ordered Milo to return the fragment and drop the matter.

Convinced he could unlock dunamantic breakthroughs, Milo disobeyed. Gearwhistle eventually caught him mid‑experiment, temporal echoes swirling around the workshop. The confrontation shattered their relationship. Gearwhistle informed his parents of the transgression, Feeling betrayed by master and family alike, Milo left home in a storm of wounded pride.

Taking **Elira Moonshadow’s** advice to heart, Milo journeyed to **New Sharandar**, the Eladrin outpost on Toril built amid the ruins of **Old Sharandar**. Under the guidance of Fey Knight **Merrisara Winterwhite**, the Eladrin sought to restore the ancient city. Milo’s blend of sage knowledge, clock‑maker precision, and emerging chronomancy proved invaluable. He deciphered ancient elven symbols, stabilised delicate magical architecture, and applied nascent chronomantic spells—*Chronal Shift* and *Momentary Stasis*—to clear rubble and reinforce fragile structures.

While shoring up a collapsed vault deep beneath Old Sharandar, Milo’s Luxon shard resonated with a dormant *mythal node*. A violet pulse of fey‑time energy hurled him a heartbeat out of sync with reality; he rematerialised several paces away amid spiralling motes. Eladrin lorekeepers murmured that **“the mythal has marked the hare.”** From that day onward, faint violet after‑images flickered whenever Milo bent space or time. 

Through this brush with the mythal, Milo earned deeper trust. He was allowed to pore over fragmented texts, locate hidden vaults, and study the very stasis‑wards that once preserved the city—each discovery drawing him closer to understanding his Luxon fragment.
Meanwhile Milo’s younger sister, **Liora**, wrote often of prophetic dreams—mountain fortresses guarded by dwarves, snowfall in midsummer, strange forest beasts. The letters kept his conscience tethered to Neverwinter.

When news arrived that **Liora had vanished**, Milo dropped everything and hurried back to Neverwinter. There he reunited with **Serina**, who pressed into his paws a hastily folded scrap of parchment—a **cryptic note** in Liora’s own hand:

> *Do not trust the shadow,*
> *trust that I know best.*
> *I beg of you not to go look for me.*
> *If you find me, do not free me, for it will mean the end,*
> *the chained released*

Guilt‑stricken, Milo launched a frantic search through the city's dockside taverns, guild archives, and back‑alley informants, chasing any flicker of his sister’s trail. To finance the investigation Milo accepted a part‑time post at Neverwinter’s **House of Knowledge**—the great cathedral‑library of **Oghma**. His relentless enquiries about planar anomalies and Sharandar mythals soon attracted the wary attention of **Professor Thaddeus Blackthorn**, a visiting dunamancer. Blackthorn, noting Milo’s subtle fey inflections and the Luxon‑lit watch he sometimes consulted, became convinced the young harengon might trigger a temporal catastrophe. His silent scrutiny now shadows Milo’s every visit to the restricted stacks.‑library of **Oghma**.

There, late one evening, Elira revealed that she served as an **Ink‑Scribe of Oghma**. Recognising Milo’s meticulous journals, she gifted him a feather quill of chalk‑white plumage. The quill refills with radiant ink only when he commits *genuinely new* discoveries to parchment—an object lesson in the Binder of Knowledge’s creed. Copywork produces nothing; creativity shines. Milo felt an almost sacred accord and quietly pledged his scholarship to Oghma’s service.

Transcribing rare scrolls with the quill, Milo soon noticed the parchment scent of old tomes whenever inspiration struck. The blank scroll sigil of Oghma ghosted across the margins of his notes, and priests offered guarded smiles whenever the quill’s ink glowed.

Rumours then reached Neverwinter of **temporal anomalies** and bizarre weather around Phandalin—summer snow, orcs descending from the mountains, and centaurs roaming the woods—echoing Liora’s dreams. Convinced the events were linked, Milo packed his Luxon‑timepiece, the white quill, and a fast‑drying supply of blank journals, and set out for Phandalin to find his sister and the truth.

## **Current Knowledge (From the DM)**
* Milo has heard that unusual weather (summer snowfall) is affecting Phandalin.
* Orcs are descending from the mountains and encroaching on the area.
* The surrounding forests now harbor centaurs.

⠀These disturbances, alongside Liora’s dream, draw Milo to Phandalin in pursuit of answers and opportunity.

# Familiar

## Tock
After experimenting with minor temporal loops in New Sharandar, Milo noticed an owl that always arrived just before he cast certain spells - as if anticipating him. Eventually, he caught it mid-hop between seconds. The creature turned out to be a temporal echo - an imprint of something that hadn’t happened yet. By naming it and binding it through ritual, he “collapsed the loop” and gave it form: Tock, a familiar quite literally outside time.

**Ren Swiftclock** (father): A meticulous and traditional horologist known for crafting timepieces of remarkable precision. He’s proud of Milo’s intellect but struggles with his son’s deviation from conventional craftsmanship into arcane experimentation. Still clings to the hope that Milo will one day return to the family workshop.
![](ChatGPT%20Image%20May%2030,%202025%20at%2009_29_50%20AM.png)<!-- {"width":436} -->

**Serina Swiftclock** (mother): Practical and nurturing, Serina is the backbone of the family business. While she admires Milo’s passion, she worries constantly about his well-being and is haunted by the disappearance of Liora. She writes him every other week, even if he doesn’t always respond.

**Liora Swiftclock** *(younger sister, 22 years old - Harengon)*: Adventurous, headstrong, and deeply empathetic. Liora often challenged the family's structured life, drawn instead to stories, adventurous dreams, and omens. Her bond with Milo was strong - they shared a love for mystery, but while he sought answers in logic and theory, she chased them in visions and instinct.

## **Friends and Allies**
**Master Tiberius Gearwhistle** *(Gnome Artificer/Wizard)*: A gnome clockmaker artificer and wizard of great renown, Gearwhistle was once Milo’s most important mentor. They first met when Milo was a teenager, fascinated by a lecture Gearwhistle gave at the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter, where Milo would often sneak in to attend public talks on magical theory, planar studies, and arcane mechanics - particularly anything involving time, motion, or enchanted constructs. Impressed by Milo’s questions, Gearwhistle offered him an apprenticeship. Over the years, their bond grew strong - almost familial - with Gearwhistle pushing Milo to challenge the limits of time theory. Despite their falling out over the Luxon fragment, Milo still respects him deeply and hopes to one day restore their connection.

**Elira Moonshadow** *(High Elf Divination Wizard, Archivist of the House of Knowledge)*: 
Elira Moonshadow is soft-spoken, observant, and insightful. Born in the Feywild city of Old Sharandar, she relocated to Neverwinter seeking knowledge and stability after witnessing the gradual decline of her homeland. She met Milo Swiftclock during his earliest studies of time magic, quickly recognizing his earnest curiosity and unique talents.

When Milo clashed with his mentor, Master Tiberius Gearwhistle, Elira empathized deeply. Drawing from her own experiences with loss and mystery, she gently encouraged Milo to explore Old Sharandar's ruins on Toril. Believing he could find answers about his Luxon fragment there, she facilitated his initial contact with the Eladrin at New Sharandar. Now, watching Milo closely as both friend and mentor, she quietly supports his ongoing quest, intrigued by how his discoveries might illuminate truths about her own lost homeland.

## **Enemies**
**Professor Thaddeus Blackthorn** *(Human Wizard, School of Dunamancy)*: A sharp-minded and exacting **Human Wizard of Dunamancy**, Professor Thaddeus Blackthorn was once a guest lecturer at the House of Knowledge and briefly collaborated with Master Gearwhistle on theoretical applications of time magic. While respected for his intellect, Blackthorn is deeply cautious—believing that temporal magic, if misused, poses existential threats.
After Milo returned to Neverwinter and began part-time work at the House of Knowledge, he gave a short presentation during a public lecture series—an overview of temporal theory and minor chronomantic applications. Most attendees saw it as theoretical rambling from a passionate young wizard, but one diagram in Milo’s notes caught Blackthorn’s attention. The magical structure resembled a pattern tied to Luxon energy—something Blackthorn recognized immediately.

Convinced the young harengon might one day cause a catastrophic breach in time, Blackthorn now watches from the shadows, ready to intervene should Milo’s curiosity go too far.
