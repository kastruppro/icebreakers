## **Backstory**
Milo Swiftclock hails from Neverwinter, where his family runs a prestigious horology workshop. His fascination with time magic led him to study chronurgy, eventually discovering a mysterious Luxon beacon fragment that amplified his abilities.

When his younger sister **Liora** disappeared after leaving a cryptic warning note, Milo set out to find her. Her note spoke of shadows, chains, and warnings not to free her - words that have gained terrible meaning as the party has encountered Tharizdun's cult.

Rumors of temporal anomalies around Phandalin - summer snow, strange creatures - echoed Liora's prophetic dreams and drew Milo to investigate. There he joined the Icebreakers.

## **Current Knowledge**
* Liora's note warned: *"Do not trust the shadow... If you find me, do not free me, for it will mean the end, the chained released"*
* The Swiftclock family has a history of researching "The Substance" - the same corruption tied to Tharizdun's cult
* His family's research journal contains notes from Sabrina Nightgale and Edward Hammel - adventurers from 200 years ago
* His grandfather Raas witnessed cult members using The Substance to open triangular portals

## Familiar

### Tock
An owl familiar that exists outside normal time. Milo first noticed Tock appearing moments *before* he cast certain spells, as if anticipating him. The creature turned out to be a temporal echo - an imprint of something that hadn't happened yet. By naming it and binding it, Milo "collapsed the loop" and gave it form.

## **Family**

![[attachments/milo-portrait.png]]


**[[Ren_Swiftclock|Ren Swiftclock]]** (father): A traditional horologist who runs the family's clockmaking workshop in Neverwinter.

**[[Serina_Swiftclock|Serina Swiftclock]]** (mother): Manages the family business. Was once an adventurer herself - her old spellbook contained dunamantic spells.

**[[Liora_Swiftclock|Liora Swiftclock]]** *(younger sister, 22 years old - Harengon)*: Missing. Had prophetic dreams before she disappeared. Left a warning note that eerily predicted events involving "the chained" and shadows. Finding her is Milo's primary motivation.

## **Friends and Allies**

**[[Oghma]]** *(God of Knowledge)*: Milo's patron deity. When Milo confronted Oghma's statue in frustration, the god actually answered - transporting him to a white throne room and granting him the Fey Touched feat despite claiming divine rules forbade direct intervention.

**[[Master_Tiberius_Gearwhistle|Master Tiberius Gearwhistle]]** *(Gnome Artificer/Wizard)*: Milo's former mentor. Their relationship fractured over Milo's experiments with the Luxon fragment, but Milo hopes to reconcile someday.

**[[Elira_Moonshadow|Elira Moonshadow]]** *(High Elf Divination Wizard)*: An archivist at the House of Knowledge who has supported Milo's research.

## **Key Moments**

### The Search for Liora

**Liora's Warning Note:**
Before disappearing, Liora left a cryptic message that haunts Milo:
> *"Do not trust the shadow, trust that I know best. I beg of you not to go look for me. If you find me, do not free me, for it will mean the end, the chained released."*

**Following Her Trail (Sessions 1-3):**
Milo arrived in Phandalin following rumors of temporal anomalies and strange weather - the same phenomena from Liora's prophetic dreams. He hoped these disturbances would lead him to her.

**Discovering Family History (Session 4):**
At the House of Knowledge, Milo learned his family has researched "The Substance" for generations. The family tome contains entries from Edward Hammel and Sabrina Nightgale - names that would later prove significant.

**Edward Hammel's Grave (Session 5):**
Milo visited Neverwinter's cemetery and found Edward Hammel's grave - one of the contributors to his family's research journal. A connection 200 years old.

**Liora's Prophecy to Clover (Session 10):**
Before the party left Neverwinter, Liora appeared and delivered a prophecy to Clover, her eyes turning black:
> *"A time will come when you have to choose between family and power. If you're not ready, it will be the end of the world."*

This confirmed Liora is connected to the larger Tharizdun conspiracy - but how?

**Meeting Sabrina Nightgale (Session 11):**
In the Void, Milo encountered Sabrina Nightgale herself - now a ghost trapped for 200 years. She was part of an adventuring party that fought Tharizdun's cult. She revealed crucial information about the Shadow and how to free possessed individuals through binding rituals in the Void. Her name was in his family's tome - the threads are connecting.

**The Family Tome Revelations:**
Reading deeper into his family's research journal, Milo discovered:
- The cult calls themselves "The Chained"
- His grandfather Raas witnessed cult members opening triangular portals with The Substance
- The same portals Cora uses to escape

### Campaign Highlights

**Divine Audience with Oghma (Session 10):**
Frustrated by dead ends in finding Liora, Milo confronted Oghma's statue at the House of Knowledge. The god responded personally, bringing Milo to his divine realm and granting him the Fey Touched feat.

**The Void Journey (Session 11):**
Traveled through the underworld to reach Waterdeep. Met Sabrina Nightgale and learned the binding ritual that could free possessed individuals.

**Waterdeep Arena Victory (Session 13):**

**The Masquerade Infiltration (Sessions 17-18):**
Milo's tactical planning helped the party infiltrate House Castellers, gathering critical intelligence about the cult.

**Dream Realm Battle (Session 21):**

**Rescue Planning (Session 22):**
Milo provided crucial intelligence about Lord Neverember's location - chained in a ritual chamber with 8-10 cultists.
