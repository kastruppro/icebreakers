## **Backstory**
Jaspar Starshade is an Aasimar with a mysterious past, even to himself. Little is known about his origins, though visions in [[The_Void|the Void]] have hinted at a complicated celestial heritage.

Jaspar made his home in the streets of [[Neverwinter]], surviving through quick wits, nimble fingers, and an easy smile. Rather than hoard his ill-gotten gains, he became a Robin Hood-like figure, stealing from wealthy merchants and nobles to support orphaned street children who had no one else to care for them.

He maintained a hideout at an abandoned warehouse at the [[Neverwinter]] docks, which he affectionately nicknamed "JSSP" (Jaspar's Secret Toilet Place). From there, he ran small cons and distributed food and coin to those in need.

When the party first met Jaspar at the Moonstone Mask in [[Neverwinter]], he was attempting to sell fake "unfreezing potions" to desperate citizens during the dragon crisis. [[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo]] quickly detected the potions weren't magical, but rather than turn him in, the party recognized Jaspar's good heart beneath the con artist exterior.

## **The Void Encounter - Meeting His "Father"**

During the party's first passage through [[The_Void|the Void]] (Session 7), each member experienced individual visions and temptations. Jaspar's vision was unique among the party:

**The Vision:**
- He saw a familiar house in [[Neverwinter]]
- Found a crib with a child, and a woman singing
- A divine being appeared, claiming to be his creator
- The being revealed Jaspar is an Aasimar, made "in his image"
- Claimed to have created Jaspar specifically to save the world
- Jaspar asked for time to think, neither accepting nor rejecting outright

**Second Void Encounter (Session 11):**
- In a dark throne room, Jaspar encountered a floating cyst (possibly [[Tharizdun]]'s "shell")
- Met an entity claiming to be his "Father"
- Received a sample of power - warm orange-red energy that infused him
- The "Father" gave him a crucial warning: **"Don't trust [[Cora]] - she'll use shadow to destroy everything."**

The true nature of this "Father" entity remains unclear. Whether it is truly Jaspar's celestial parent, a manifestation of [[Tharizdun]]'s deception, or something else entirely is one of the campaign's enduring mysteries.

## **Prophetic Dreams**

Jaspar possesses prophetic dreams that set him apart from other mortals. When the goddess [[Desna]] read the dreams of various individuals (Session 19), she revealed something unprecedented about Jaspar:

> "Jaspar's dreams can come to pass - prophetic. Even I cannot affect them."

His dreams exist in a crossover between the dream realm and something else, making them immune to even divine interference. This unique ability may be connected to his Aasimar heritage or to the mysterious power granted by his "Father" in the Void.

## **Notable Abilities & Moments**

**Social Excellence:**
- Rolled a Natural 29 on Persuasion to convince [[Ammalia_Castellers|Ammalia Castellers]] to negotiate (Session 20)
- Rolled a 23 on Performance to smooth over social situations (Session 22)
- Successfully charmed noble [[Isabella_Adabrent|Isabella Adabrent]] at the masquerade, revealing his angelic heritage

**Combat:**

**Quick Thinking:**

- Trusts in luck - solved the jester puzzle by flipping coins to let Tymora decide (Session 20)
- Carved the triangular portal in [[Axeholm]] after the corrupted scimitar responded to him (Session 7)

## **Romantic Interest**

**[[Isabella_Adabrent|Isabella Adabrent]]** - A noblewoman from House Adabrent, which controls the [[Waterdeep]] docks. Jaspar danced with her at the [[House_Castellers_Estate|Castellers]]' masquerade ball (Session 18), revealing his angelic heritage to win her over. She became smitten and later sent him perfumed pink notes with magical [[Pepper_Nuts|pepper nuts]] (Session 19). The party attempted to visit her at House Adabrent but were turned away by guards. This budding romance remains unresolved.

## **Key Relationships**

### Party Members
- **[[Milo_Swiftclock|Milo Swiftclock]]:** Fellow adventurer; Milo first detected Jaspar's fake potions but recognized his good intentions

- **[[Clover]]:** Fellow Harengon connection; often work together on infiltration and stealth missions

## **Equipment of Note**

### Jaspar's Rapier
His blade reacts to the mysterious alien slime/substance connected to the [[Tharizdun]] cult. When he discovered the substance on [[Neverwinter]]'s harbor walls (Session 3), his sword responded to it. The corrupted scimitar and "the substance" were also drawn to him during the [[Axeholm]] ritual (Session 7).
