## **Backstory**
Modred De Moray was born into House De Moray, a noble family in Waterdeep. The house banner displays two crossed swords, one aflame, on blue field. His childhood was marked by the weight of nobility - expectations, appearances, and parties among Waterdeep's elite.

His mother **Morgane** was a caring presence in his life, but his father **Godwin De Moray** descended into depression and alcoholism over the years. The family dynamics became increasingly strained, with Godwin's drinking and emotional instability making life at House De Moray unbearable.

Modred had a childhood friend named **Percy**, a hedonistic noble who remembers Modred as "fun" and someone who "was at parties." But that carefree version of Modred faded as his family fell apart.

Unable to endure his father's behavior any longer, Modred left home. His departure, combined with his younger brother **Arthur's** disappearance and his mother's departure to become a priestess of Tyr, broke Godwin completely. As Ulrik the house guard later explained: "He had lost both of his sons."

After Modred left, Godwin focused his attention on Arthur. Together, father and son investigated rumors of cult activity and found cultists performing a ritual in the forest outside Waterdeep. Arthur returned from that encounter "changed" - aggressive, not himself. Then Arthur vanished entirely.

What Godwin and Arthur had stumbled upon was a cult of **Tharizdun**, the Chained One. The shadow entity that possessed Arthur would later declare him "a fine vessel for Tharizdun."

Modred eventually found himself in Phandalin, where he joined forces with Milo Swiftclock and others to investigate a dragon attack and the strange freezing magic affecting the region.

## **The Corruption**

Modred's corruption began when he used a **corrupted dagger** to open triangular portals - the same method used by the cult of Tharizdun. After drawing a portal with the dagger at the JSSP Warehouse, Modred felt "something has been lost."

The corruption manifests as **blackened fingers**, starting at the fingertips and slowly spreading:
- Initially appeared at the tips of his fingers
- Spread to halfway down all fingers within a day
- Continues to progress over time

**Key Facts About the Corruption:**
- Many others are afflicted - all connected to Tharizdun's cult
- Progression takes months, not days (not immediately fatal)
- **Swift Flower herb** can temporarily slow the corruption
- Lesser Restoration has no effect
- Detect Magic and Identify reveal nothing
- **Sebastian** (Leader of Cloak Tower) has the same corruption but far more advanced - his entire hands are black

Modred conceals his blackened fingers with gloves to avoid drawing attention.

## **Connection to Tyr**

Despite never being particularly religious, Modred has developed a deepening relationship with **Tyr**, the God of Justice.

**Divine Vision (Session 13):**
- At the House of Justice in Waterdeep, Modred and Clover were pulled through the hollow eyes of a Tyr statue into a dark space
- A black dog with golden eyes led them to an armory
- Tyr's eyes manifested in a statue, giving them a sacred quest
- Quest: Retrieve Tyr's stolen gauntlets from cult ruins in the forest

**Tyr's Quest:**
- The gauntlets were stolen from Tyr's armory
- They are placed in a Temple of Tharizdun
- The gauntlets can be used to push Tharizdun further into imprisonment
- Four Tharizdun ruins around Waterdeep each contain chains that must be destroyed

**Boon of Tyr (Granted Session 16):**
> "As an action, you can sacrifice some or all of your hit points to give to another creature, but you take on all recent injuries and conditions from that creature, including diseases, dismemberment, and death."

**Ongoing Divine Connection (Session 22):**
- A black dog with golden eyes appeared to Modred in the Temple of Tyr
- Tyr summoned him again to his divine workshop
- Warned about Tharizdun's acceleration: "Things are moving fast for the Betrayer God"
- Sensed "great power" emanating from somewhere within Waterdeep

## **Family**

**Godwin De Moray** (father): Once a powerful noble patriarch of House De Moray, now a broken shell consumed by guilt, hatred, and shame. Unkempt beard, unwashed, surrounded by empty bottles in a darkened estate. When the party visited House De Moray, he attacked them with Wall of Fire, screaming "I have no son. My son is gone. Leave." His dreams (revealed by Desna) are full of guilt, hatred, and shame. Recently visited the Temple of Tyr while sober, asking specifically for Modred.

**Morgane** (mother): Left Godwin years ago due to his descent into madness. Now serves as a devoted priestess at the Temple of Tyr in Waterdeep. Provides healing, divine guidance, and sanctuary to those in need. Knew Modred was coming to Waterdeep through Tyr's prophecy. She maintains complicated feelings about Godwin but reports when he reaches out.

**Arthur De Moray** (younger brother): Possessed by a shadow entity connected to Tharizdun. The party first found him frozen in the forest outside Phandalin, wearing a spiral cult symbol necklace. A red-purple substance (the shadow entity) was visible trying to escape the ice. The entity declared him "a fine vessel for Tharizdun." Arthur is currently under protective wards placed by Master Tiberius Gearwhistle, kept at the Swiftclock family home in Neverwinter.

## **Friends and Allies**

**The Neverwinter Icebreakers** (adventuring party):
- **Milo Swiftclock** - Harengon Chronurgy Wizard, fellow founding member
- **Jaspar Starshade** - Aasimar Rogue, trusted companion
- **Clover** - Harengon Moon Druid, joined later, shares connection to Tyr

**Morgane** (mother): Though their relationship was strained by the family's collapse, Morgane remains an ally and source of divine support.

**Percy** (childhood friend): A hedonistic noble from Modred's past. While they've drifted apart, Percy remembers their friendship fondly. Jaspar has noted: "I have learned to tolerate Modred because he actually seems to have some good human quality sometimes. But that guy [Percy], no."

## **Enemies**

**Godwin De Moray** (father): Though technically family, Godwin's madness makes him dangerous. When Modred last visited, Godwin attacked the party. As Modred said: "Last time I went to see him, he tried to kill me."

**Tharizdun's Cult (The Chained)**: The cult responsible for Arthur's possession and the corruption spreading through Modred's hands.

**Sebastian**: Leader of the Cloak Tower, deeply corrupted (entire hands black), working with Victor Castellers on mysterious activities connected to Tharizdun.

**Victor Castellers**: Noble conspirator working with Sebastian, holding Lord Neverember prisoner in a ritual chamber.

**Cora**: The "backflipping bitch" who uses triangular portals to escape. Was waiting outside the Temple of Tharizdun when the party retrieved Tyr's gauntlets, clapping with excitement.
